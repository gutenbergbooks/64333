<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> popular translation of that dangerous term, individualism, is &ldquo;selfishness.&rdquo;
Self-dependence is a pompous phrase, and self-completion a huge
negation. The average mind seems never to grasp the fact that individualism
and democracy are synonymous terms; that self-dependence is merely
the first of one&rsquo;s intricate obligations to his universe, and self-completion
the first step toward that wider consciousness which makes the giving-out of
self valuable.
</p>

<p>
I am always feeling that some one will point out to me, with the most
embarrassing justice, the obviousness of observations like these. But invariably,
after a resolve to keep to those high levels which stretch out beyond
the boundaries of the accepted, some one engages me in a discussion&mdash;some
one who still believes in the antique theory that life proceeds for the
sake of immortality, or that a woman must choose between her charm and
the ballot; and I emerge therefrom convinced that the highest mission in
life is the dedication of oneself to the obvious, and that a valiant preaching
of truisms is the only way to get at the root of intellectual evils. It has its
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
fascinations, besides: to convince a reactionary (not that I&rsquo;ve ever done it)
that renunciation is not an ultimate end, or that truth is a good thing for all
people, is better than discovering a kindred soul. And so I proceed, without
further apology: that human being is of most use to other people who has
first become of most use to himself.
</p>

<p>
It is the war that has emphasized so overwhelmingly the triviality of
trivial things. Out of such utter dehumanization one has a vision of the
race which might emerge&mdash;a race purified of small struggles, small causes,
small patriotisms; a race animated by those big impulses which have always
made up the dreams of men. And then would come the more subtle personal
development: a race of human units purged of small ideals and ambitions,
cleansed to the point where education can at least proceed with
economy&mdash;that is, without having to destroy two ounces of superstition
to produce one ounce of knowledge. And at the foundation of such a race
structure, I believe, will be a corner stone of Individualism&mdash;or whatever
you may choose to call it. What it means is very simple: it is a matter of
heightened inner life.
</p>

<p>
Our culture&mdash;or what little we have of such a thing&mdash;is clogged by
masses of dead people who have no conscious inner life. The man who
asked, &ldquo;Did you ever see an old artist?&rdquo; put a profound question. People
get old because they have no vision. And they have no vision because
they have no inner life. Of course, any sort of inner life is impossible to
the man or woman who must be a slave instead of a human being. And
this brings us, of course, to a discussion of economic emancipation&mdash;which
I shall not take advantage of; because I want to talk here not of what the
individual should have done for him, but of what he might very well do
for himself. There are so many slaves whose bondage can be traced to no
cause except their refusal or their inability to come to life; and the significance
of the fact that spiritual resourcefulness is most rare among those
persons who have the most leisure to cultivate it need not be emphasized
even in an article devoted to the apparent.
</p>

<p>
Human weakness is reducible to so many causes beside that much-abused
one of &ldquo;circumstance.&rdquo; We talk so much nonsense about people not
being able to help themselves. The truth is that people can help themselves
out of nine-tenths of all the trouble they get into. (We&rsquo;ll leave the
other tenth to circumstance.) If they could only be made to realize this,
or that if they are helped out by some one else they might as well stay in
trouble! To be dragged out is more desirable than starving to death, because
it is more sensible, and because people are so sentimental in their
attitude toward receiving that one welcomes almost any emergency which
drives them to accepting aid with grace and honesty: <em>anything</em> to teach a
man that he need not smirk about taking what he himself would like to
give without being smirked at! But in spite of this, one must help himself
to anything which is to be of positive value to him; and must
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
learn that personality gets what it demands. However, this begins to
sound like a pamphlet from East Aurora....
</p>

<p>
As a result of our shabby thinking on the subject of self-dependence
we have lowered our standards of the exceptional to an alarming degree.
We call that person exceptional who does what almost any one might do&mdash;but
doesn&rsquo;t. For instance:
</p>

<p>
The average girl of twenty in a conventional home hates to be told
that she must not read Havelock Ellis or make friends with those dreadful
persons known vaguely as &ldquo;socialists,&rdquo; or that she must not work when
she happens to believe that work is a beautiful thing. She is submerged
in the ghastly sentimentalities of a tradition-soaked atmosphere&mdash;and
heaven knows that sentimentalities of that type are difficult to break away
from. It takes not only brains, but what William James called the fundamental
human virtue&mdash;bravery&mdash;to do it. And so the girl gives up the
fight and moans that circumstances were too much for her. The next
stage of her development shows her passing around gentle advice to all
her friends on the noble theme of not being &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and living only for
oneself; how one must sacrifice to the general good&mdash;never having had the
courage or the insight to find out what the general good might really be.
Thus are our incapacities extended. The girl who did break away she regards
secretly as remarkable&mdash;which is not necessarily true. It is not
that the second girl is remarkable, but that the first one is inadequate.
</p>

<p>
The average man of thirty-five slaves all day in an office and comes
home at night to wheel the baby around the block and fall asleep over the
newspaper. He has lost any feeling of rebellion, simply because he feels
that he must. His permanent attitude is that all men are more or less
in the same condition (or should be, if they&rsquo;re well-behaved), and that to
part with a vision after college is what any man of sense must do. His
neighbor with an eye on something beyond an office desk and a go-cart is
a dreamer or a fool; if the neighbor makes good with his dream, then he
is a remarkable man of extraordinary capabilities. Which is not necessarily
true, either; the dreamer has simply scorned that attitude which has
been so aptly epitomized as &ldquo;the second choice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There are as many phlegmatic radicals as there are conservatives; and
there is no type among them more exasperating than the one that is content
to sit around and <em>be</em> radical&mdash;and be nothing else. The lazy evasiveness
of the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; with his the-world-owes-me-a-living air positively
sicken me. Why should the world owe anybody anything except a protection
against that <em>lack of struggle</em> which cramps one&rsquo;s intellectual muscles
so hideously?
</p>

<p>
And then there is that most unpleasant type of all&mdash;the man who boasts
of how he will use his chance when he gets it. He always gets it, of
course; but he doesn&rsquo;t know it. And when it comes out boldly and takes
him by the ear he becomes terrified and slips back under the cover of
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
things as they are. His is the most unattractive kind of intellectual cowardice,
because it involves so many lies; it is simply a rapid sequence of
boasting and fright and refusing to meet the truth.
</p>

<p>
Here they all are&mdash;the uncourageous company of the second choice:
the half-people, the makeshifts, the compromisers, the near-adventurers.
How pale and ambling they look; how they crawl through the world with
their calculating side looks, ready to take any second-rate thing when the
first-rate one costs too much. Oh, it is a sad sight!
</p>

<p>
We must be more brave! We must be more fine! We must be more
demanding! The saddest aspect of the whole thing is that choice is such a
tiny element in the process of becoming. It is after one has chosen highly
that his real struggle&mdash;and his real joy&mdash;begins. And only on such a
basis is built up that intensity of inner life which is the sole compensation
one can wrest from a world of mysterious terrors ... and of ecstasies too
dazzling to be shared.

<em>August 28, 1914.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">s</span> I sit here, I can see out of my window the Red Cross flag flying over
Devonshire House. Only one short month ago I sat at this same window
and looked at Devonshire House, glistening with lights, and all its
doors wide open, for the duke and duchess were giving an evening party.
Powdered footmen stood under the porte-cochère, and the yard was filled
with motors; it was all extremely well-ordered and gay.
</p>

<p>
I watched the people arriving and leaving, for a long time. It was a
very late party, and it was not only broad daylight, but brilliant sunshine,
before they went home. They did have such a good time, those boys and
girls, and they ended by coming out on the balcony and shouting and hurrahing
for fully ten minutes. How many of those young men were among
the &ldquo;two thousand casualties&rdquo; at the Battle of Charleroi, of which we have
just got news?
</p>

<p>
Devonshire House is as busy this afternoon, but it is no longer gay.
In the yard is a long wooden shed, with a corrugated iron roof; there are
two doors on opposite sides, like barn doors, and black against the light of
the farther door I can see men sitting at a table, and boy scouts running
upon errands. The yard is filled with motors again, and there is a buzz of
coming and going. Yesterday a man brought a sort of double-decked portable
stretcher, with a place above and below, and a group stood round it
and talked about it for a long time. For this is the headquarters of the
Red Cross Society. So, in one short month, has life changed, here in London.
</p>

<p>
A month ago I toiled up the narrow stairs of a little outhouse behind
the Poetry Bookshop, and in an atmosphere of overwhelming sentimentality,
listened to Mr. Rupert Brooke whispering his poems. To himself,
it seemed, as nobody else could hear him. It was all artificial and precious.
One longed to shout, to chuck up one&rsquo;s hat in the street when one got outside;
anything, to show that one was not quite a mummy, yet.
</p>

<p>
Now, I could weep for those poor, silly people. After all they were
happy; the world they lived in was secure. Today this horrible thing has
fallen upon them, and not for fifty years, say those who know, can Europe
recover herself and continue her development. Was the world too &ldquo;precious&rdquo;,
did it need these violent realities to keep its vitality alive? History
may have something to say about that; we who are here can only see the
pity and waste of it.
</p>

<p>
So little expectation of war was there, so academic the &ldquo;conversations&rdquo;
between the powers seemed, that on the Friday, preceding the declaration
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
of war, we went down to Dorchester and Bath for a week-end outing. It
was rather a shock to find the market-place at Salisbury filled with cannon,
and the town echoing with soldiers. The waiter at the inn, however, assured
us that it was only man&oelig;uvres. But the next day our chauffeur, who had
been fraternizing with the soldiers, told us that it was not man&oelig;uvres; they
had started for man&oelig;uvres, but had been turned round, and were now on
their way back to their barracks.
</p>

<p>
As we came back from Bath, on Monday, we were told that gasolene
was over five shillings a can. That was practically saying that England had
gone to war. But she had not, nor did she, until twelve o&rsquo;clock that night.
When we reached our hotel we found a state bordering on panic. There
was no money to be got, and all day long, for two days, people (Americans)
had been arriving from the Continent. Without their trunks, naturally.
There was no one to handle trunks at the stations in Paris. These refugees
were all somewhat hysterical; perhaps they exaggerated when they spoke
of disorder in Paris; later arrivals seemed to think so. But we are untried
in war&mdash;war round the corner. It is a terrifying nightmare which we
cannot take for reality. Or could not. For it is now three weeks since
the war burst over us, and already we accustom ourselves to the new condition.
That is perhaps the most horrible part of it.
</p>

<p>
But that first night in London I shall never forget. A great crowd of
people with flags marched down Piccadilly, shouting: &ldquo;We want war! We
want war!&rdquo; They sang the Marseillaise, and it sounded savage, abominable.
The blood-lust was coming back, which we had hoped was gone forever
from civilized races.
</p>

<p>
But the Londoners are a wonderful people. Or perhaps they have no
imagination. London goes on, and goes on just as it did before, as far as
I can see. I understand that the American papers, possibly taking their
cue from the German papers, say that London is like a military camp, that
soldiers swarm in the streets, and that its usual activities are all stopped. It
is not true. &ldquo;Business as usual&rdquo; has become a sort of motto. And it is as
usual,&mdash;perhaps a bit too much so. The mass of the people cannot be
brought to realize the possibility of an invasion. In vain the papers warn
them, they believe the navy to be invincible. And Heaven grant that it is!
</p>

<p>
When, that first week of the war, bank holiday was extended to four
days instead of one; when the moratorium was declared, which exempted
the banks from paying on travellers cheques and letters-of-credit; and when,
to add to that, so many boats were taken off, and there were no sailings to
be got for love or money, something closely approaching a panic broke out
among the Americans. And what wonder! They felt caught like rats in a
trap, with the impassable sea on one side and the advancing Germans on
the other. For Americans have not been brought up with the tradition of
England&rsquo;s invincibility at sea. They have heard of John Paul Jones and
the &ldquo;Bonhomme Richard.&rdquo; And they have imagination. I was told that one
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
woman had killed herself in an access of fear, and I have heard of another
who has had to be put in an asylum, her mind given way under the strain.
Many of these people had no money, and they could not get any; they
came from the Continent and had to find lodgings, and they could offer
neither money nor credit. The Embassy had no way of meeting the strain
flung upon it. The Ambassador is not a rich man, and the calls for money
were endless. Finally some public-spirited American gentlemen started a
Committee, with offices at the Hotel Savoy, to help stranded Americans.
And the work they have done has been so admirable that it is hard to find
words to describe it. The Committee cashes cheques, gets steamship bookings,
suggests hotels and lodgings, provides clothes, meets trains. I cannot
write the half it does, but it makes one exceedingly proud. I do not believe
that there is an American in London who has not helped the Committee with
time or money, or been helped by it.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the panicky ones have all been cared for and gone home, or
perhaps man is a very adaptable animal. But we who are still in London
have settled down and accepted things. The town is not like a camp, but
still regiments of soldiers in khaki pass along fairly often. And during the
few days when it was my duty to meet trains at Victoria Station, no train
from the South Coast either arrived or left without its quota of soldiers.
We motored down to Portsmouth last Sunday, and we were stopped at the
entrance to the town and asked to prove that we were not Germans. It
was not a very difficult task. Portsmouth is swarming with soldiers, but
until we reached it, the only evidence of changed conditions was the strange
absence of cyclists and motor-cyclists on the roads.
</p>

<p>
The other day I was waiting on a street corner. I was going to cross
over and buy a paper. (The papers bring out new editions all day long,
and in taxis, on buses, walking along the street, every one is reading a paper.)
Suddenly I heard someone shout my name, and there were Richard Aldington
and F. G. Flint. They were in excellent spirits; Richard Aldington had
just been down to put his name on the roster of those willing to enlist. Flint
cannot enlist; he is already serving his country in the Post Office, and sits
all day long in the most important and most dangerous building in the world
next to the Bank of England. It is guarded by soldiers and surrounded by
bomb-nets, but London is full of spies! I thought of the exquisite and
delicate work of these two men in the <em>Anthologie Des Imagistes</em>, and it
seemed barbarous that war should touch them&mdash;as cruel and useless as the
shattering of a Greek vase by a cannon ball. I remembered the letters of
Henri Régnault I had read, long ago. I remembered how he gave up his
studio in Algiers and came back to fight for France, and died in the trenches.
We read of these things, but when we find ourselves standing on a street
corner talking to two young poets who are preparing to face the same experiences&mdash;Well!
It is different!
</p>

<p>
This is one side. There is, unhappily, another. Something that one
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
feared, and is not glad to see. There is not that realization that there should
be of the danger England is in, nor that rush to defend her that one associates
with the English temper. They are not enlisting as they should, and
that is the bare truth of the matter.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> And there is a certain hysteria beginning
to show, which is terribly un-English, as &ldquo;English&rdquo; has hitherto been.
The appeal to men to enlist has become almost a scream of terror. The
papers are full of it, in editorials, in letters from private persons. And still
the Government delays to declare general mobilization. Instead, it adopts
measures which seem positively childish. Lord Kitchener asks the taxi-cabs
to carry placards urging enlistment, and when some of the union cab-drivers
refuse, the papers solemnly urge a patriotic public to boycott the placardless
cabs. And all England is supposed to be under martial law! Could anything
be more miserably humorous? It is hard to imagine Wellington asking
favors of cabmen, and, when he was refused, begging the populace to
punish the offenders. The following advertisement in this morning&rsquo;s <em>Times</em>
illustrates the enthusiasm and the apathy which are rife at the same time:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Doctor&rsquo;s wife, middle-aged, will undertake to perform the work of any tramway
conductor, coachman, shop-assistant, or other married worker with children, provided
that worker will undertake to enlist and fight for his country in our hour of
need. All wages earned will be paid over to the wife and family.&mdash;Apply Mrs. Lowry,
1, Priory-terrace, Kew Green, S.W.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Perhaps one of the saddest evidences of a changed England is Mr.
H. G. Wells&rsquo;s letter to Americans in <em>The Chronicle</em> of August 24th. For an
Englishman to <em>implore</em> a foreign country to do or not to do anything, is new.
Englishmen have not been used to beg weakly, with tears in their eyes.
Whatever one may think of Mr. Wells&rsquo;s contention in this letter, the tone
in which it is written is a lamentable evidence of panic. Panic has never
been an English trait, and neither has whining servility. And the Americans
are the last people in the world to be moved by it. We are a just
people, and we admire valor. I think Mr. Wells need not have <em>stooped</em> to
ask us for justice or sympathy.
</p>

<p>
After all, it purports little to point out the spots on the sun. England
is still the mother-country of most Americans, even if that was a good while
ago. And we love her. She has given us not only our blood, but our civilization.
Since this war broke out she has harbored us and kept her ships
running for us. In Paris, one must get a permit from the police to stay or
leave. In England, one is free and unmolested. England has always been
the refuge of oppressed peoples. Does she need to ask our sympathy now
that she is, herself, oppressed? Neutral we must be, and neutral we shall be,
but we are not a military nation, and despotism can never attract us.
</p>

<p>
Every American would rather a bungling democracy than the wisest
despot who ever breathed.

New Wars for Old

</p>

<p class="book">
<em>The Mob</em>, by John Galsworthy. [Charles Scribner&rsquo;s Sons, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> confess to a certain disappointment at this play. Not that it is a
bad play. It would be hard for Galsworthy to write badly. But, both dramatically
and philosophically, it might have been better, and, judging by
Galsworthy&rsquo;s previous work, could easily have been better. <em>Justice</em>, <em>Strife</em>
and <em>The Pigeon</em>, for instance, are immeasurably superior to this play.
</p>

<p>
The theme of the play is the protest of an upper-class statesman
against a war of conquest with a small nation in which his country is
engaged. His wife and family are all normally patriotic and his stand
estranges them. His governmental position is lost, as is also his parliamentary
membership. Sir Stephen More makes a magnificent stand for his
ideal. His courage and consistency result in his death at the hands of the
victory-drunken mob. And yet,&mdash;I was left cold.
</p>

<p>
It must have been my realization of the futility of his cause which killed
my warmth; and yet I am an admirer of forlorn hopes and their leaders.
It was, perhaps, more the artificiality of his espousement of peace, and the
grounds for this espousement, which failed to move me.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, More belongs to the class which really benefits by war:
the monied, aristocratic and governing class. To such people patriotism is
a natural and inevitable source of action, as it is rooted in their very substantial
stake in the country. Love of the fatherland, which has given them
so much, and the duty of fighting its wars, or of encouraging others to fight
them, is a very vital and vigorous thing in them. Against this, More had
nothing to advance but a very negative propaganda: an appeal to the strong
to act &ldquo;honorably&rdquo; by pitying and sparing the weak (a perfectly sickening
reason); and the invoking of a hazy abstract idea of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; which has
about as much power to influence men&rsquo;s actions as a policeman has to maintain
morality.
</p>

<p>
More was a member of the imperial class; and he became a &ldquo;Little
Englander.&rdquo; He was a member of a soldierly class; and he became an advocate
of peace for peace&rsquo;s sake. He opposed a cloudy concept of conduct,&mdash;utterly
unrelated to the facts of life,&mdash;to a deep-rooted instinct founded on
the material benefit of his own class. And this was the reason of his failure.
He had nothing grippingly affirmative to give the people, and he should
have realized that to appeal to the rulers was hopeless.
</p>

<p>
A great, popular, full-blooded thing like war must have a great, popular,
full-blooded thing to counteract it. Also, we must remember that the life
of the masses of people is not such a beautiful and colored thing that death
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
on the battle-field is such a very dreadful alternative. Painting the horrors
of war,&mdash;its sordid and unheroic side,&mdash;is not enough. Nothing could be
more sordid and unheroic than the gray existence of the factory hand. A
new, full gospel of affirmation, revolt, and militancy must be set against the
war-passion. The spirit of conflict is good; it is essential to continuity;
it is the breaker of old forms and the releaser of new life. It can, however,
be directed along newer and more gainful channels than that of international
market-struggles.
</p>

<p>
The people who can stop wars are the people who fight wars. And
they can stop them by the divinely simple method of refusing to fight; and
by refusing to provide food, clothing, and transportation to any that do
fight. The worker operates industry and can shut off supplies if he will.
Anyone who preserves a faith that the governors may end war is sustaining
himself with a straw.
</p>

<p>
But if the people, the mass of producers, are to stop war, they must
first be stirred; and a negative pacific preaching will never stir them. Only
a call to a greater and more vital war can move them.
</p>

<p>
Such a war exists. It is the hand-to-hand struggle against exploitation,
against the economic bondage which has fettered the minds and bodies
of the larger portion of the race for ages past. This conflict is affirmative:
it calls for courage, endurance, and comradeship. Also it is true, because it
has its roots in the biological basis of life&mdash;love and hunger. The stir of
passion is in it: the passion of hate and the passion of love, and also the
love of a good fight; and without these elements there is no war worth
the while.
</p>

<p>
But all this, it seems, More did not realize. And, had he realized it,
he could have done but little. He was too removed from the &ldquo;mob&rdquo; to
speak their tongue, too far from them to share their feeling, too alien for
his words to gain a foothold in the crannies of their being.
</p>

<p>
The mob that killed More had made More, and all others of his kind.
The despised mob had fought his battles on the field of war and on the field
of industry. For the one they killed they had nurtured thousands. Inchoate
and all but inarticulate, in this mob is the divine stuff out of which shall
be formed the master-people to come, when once they decide to fight their
own war instead of that of their task-masters.

the fact that since the first week in August we have had no sterling news

in Russia, of her recent moods and aspirations, will enable us to venture
a guess or two as to the potential results of the present imbroglio. The

In a recent article an eminent Russian publicist thus characterizes the
modern literature of his native land:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It is quite clear: With the death of Tolstoy our literature also expired. Not
orphaned, bereaved; it died, came to an end, perished....
</p>

<p>
In fact, what does our modern literature teach us? It positively preaches all the
instincts, the complete &ldquo;credo&rdquo; of the bestialized criminal. Self-despite, sacrilege,
sexual licentiousness, political mutiny, commendation of crime, hooliganish all-negation,
stalest individualism, morals of an outlaw, the ideology of fratricide-Cain, the
codex of an apache and Jack-the-Ripper.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Taking the above philippic <em>cum grano salis</em>, we must, however, consider
it as a characteristic phenomenon illustrating the contemporaneous moods
of Russian society in the process of its prolonged morbid crisis. For if
literature is supposed to be the mirror of life; if in literature we find the
true reflection of a people&rsquo;s feelings, cravings, ideals, struggles,&mdash;then Russia
presents the most vivid demonstration of this truth. In no other country has
literature reflected real life with such a consequential and accurate preciseness
as has that of the land of the Czar in all its epochs and stages. If,
therefore, the modern Russian literature has a morbid aspect; if its heroes
preach adultery, crime, free love, and praise the lowest mob instincts; if it
does, and to a large extent it unquestionably does represent a base degradation,
then we must needs look into the very life of that unhappy country in
search for the causes of its mental affliction, then &ldquo;something is the matter&rdquo;
with holy Russia.

</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
A filthy torrent flows over wide Russia&mdash;a torrent of savageness, bloodthirstiness,
cruelty, sexual wantonness, intoxicated cynicism. The torrent overflows and deluges
and infects all spots of life and ruins the soul of the nation.... The man, the
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
person is of no value or consideration. There is no self-respect nor respect for
others. The provoked instincts know of no hold-back. The sexual passion intermingles
with the passion to torture and to tyrannize. The atmosphere is veiled in
a bloody fog. The venom has penetrated all over, through all ranks of the population.
Bloody and shameful deeds have become an every-day occurrence not only
among the higher society&mdash;army officers, bureaucrats, noblemen, cultured and uncultured
capitalists; you meet with the same crimes likewise among the poor urban
populace, among the lower strata, the so-called &ldquo;masses&rdquo;; similar dramas occur also
in the village.... The same all over. Everywhere the nonchalance disposition.
Everywhere the morbid passion in the first place. &ldquo;I want&mdash;and I must. And to the

The Russian dailies give amazing material for the student of sociology.
The impartial chronicling of daily events tells us a dreadful story of a
people that have lost every sense of moral sensitiveness and value of life.
Facts of wildest debauchery and corruption, murder and suicide, defloration
and parricide, to the accompaniment of governmental executions, hanging
and shooting, fill up column after column of the periodical press. A Russian
journalist remarks:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
And this is our every-day life. This occurs every day, every hour. It is not any
more a sensation or a crying extraordinary occasion that awakens general attention

one does not notice such items of news&mdash;so trivial have they become. &ldquo;Ah,

<p class="noindent">
The definition of Russian literature as Heroic was perfectly true until
a few years ago. The literature, like the life itself, had been a continuous
heroism. The harder the oppressions from above, the more resolute was
the fighting spirit below; the wilder the reaction that raged over the throbbing
country, the loftier were the ideals of the struggling people; the more
acute the sufferings of the gloomy present, the brighter and the more attractive
appeared the perspectives of the future.
</p>

<p>
Ever since the first revolutionary outbreak in 1825, the so-called Insurrection
of the Decembrists, the Russian populace has had one great ideal,
one ardent all-embracing aim&mdash;the overthrow of the autocracy, the impersonification
of evil, injustice, and tyranny. This goal has been the sense of
life, the justification of man&rsquo;s existence, the holy spirit elevating and purifying
the miserable subjects of the Czar, the solace for the eternal humiliation,
the compensation for the unique martyrdom of that unfortunate nation.
</p>

<p>
A great, an inestimable rôle has been played by Russian literature in
the education of the public. Though restricted by draconic rules of the
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
bigoted state censorship, it succeeded in speaking to the public in an Aesopic
tongue, training the readers in the gentle art of understanding between the
lines. It preached idealism, self-sacrifice, unbounded devotion and love to
their suffering compatriots, and unlimited deadly hatred for the common
foe&mdash;the Tyrant.
</p>

<p>
The elevating influence of that idealistic literature has been displayed
most manifestly upon Russian youth, particularly upon university students.
The susceptible young souls followed the call of their great teachers and
guides, and plunged with zeal and ardor into the battle. Selfishness, life&rsquo;s
diversions and conventionalities had no place in their puritanic minds. To
fight for freedom was their only &ldquo;sport&rdquo;; to enlighten the masses, their sole
&ldquo;amusement&rdquo;; to die on the scaffold for the Ideal, the climax of happiness.
</p>

<p>
In that enduring bitter struggle there have been but two sides, two
antagonistic camps&mdash;the government and the people. On one side rude
force, violence, and outspoken retrogression; on the other&mdash;notwithstanding
minute differences in party platforms and theoretical principles&mdash;an all-uniting
ocean of lofty ideals, spiritual forces, great hopes, boundless altruism.
</p>

<p>
<em>Noblesse oblige.</em> The great common cravings and aims must needs have
cultivated a high standard of morals and intercourse among the people. The
able correspondent of <em>The London Daily Chronicle</em>, Henry W. Nevinson,
who had had the opportunity of closely observing Russian life during the
unforgettable red years of 1905-1906, justly remarked:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
To have a cause like that (the Revolution), to dwell with danger for the sake
of it every day and night, to confront an enemy, vital, pitiless, almost omnipotent,
and execrable beyond words&mdash;what other cause can compare to that, not only in
grandeur, but in the satisfaction of intellect and courage and love and every human
faculty? So tyranny brings its compensations.
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="section" id="IV">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The general strike and uprising of October, 1905, compelled the obstinate
Czar to &ldquo;grant&rdquo; a tolerable constitution. It seemed that the long struggle
had come to an end, that the desired goal having been reached, the bitterly
fought-for concession having been attained, there was no reason for continuing
the bloody war between the government and the people. The Manifesto
of 30 (17) October, 1905, pledged liberty of speech, press, and public
meetings, equal rights for all, and a representative government with a comparatively
liberal election-system.
</p>

<p>
Only those who happened to abide in Russia during the autumn months
of 1905 are able to comprehend the indescribable joy of the population at
the announcement of the Manifesto. An intoxication of happiness reigned
all over the country, strangers embraced and kissed each other, everyone
was addressed with the hearty &ldquo;comrade,&rdquo; a sincere feeling of brotherhood
and mutual love overfilled all hearts, and from Finland to farthest Siberia,
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
from the polar regions to the Black Sea, over the entire vast empire thundered
the exalted cry: &ldquo;Long live liberty!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The enchantment, however, was of a short duration. The people soon
found out that they had put too much confidence in the paper pledge of the
Czar, and that they should not have laid their weapons aside. The solemn
promise declared from the heights of the throne was broken. One after
one the pledged liberties were taken away, and a wave of brutal repression
and massacre swept over the tormented land. Only too late one could recollect
with the American Russologue Joubert, the ever-new aphorism of Bertrand:
&ldquo;The tree of liberty can grow only when it is watered with the blood
of the tyrants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The government recovered its senses after the first collapse, and decided
to play its game on the obscurity and ignorance of the army. The simple-minded
soldiers, themselves miserable peasants or workingmen, were ordered
to shoot and flog their fathers and brothers, their friends and defenders;
and they fulfilled their official duty with incomparable brutality. The revolution
was betrayed and strangled. Its leaders were shot, hanged, or banished;
the free press shut up, liberal parties and meetings forbidden, and
once more the monster-bureaucracy held in its claws the palpitating unhappy
land.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="V">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Let us return to the problem: What is the matter with Russia? What
is the cause of its general decay and demoralization? The revolution proved
a failure. The masses&mdash;the army particularly&mdash;were unprepared for carrying
out the long cherished ideal. But that was not all. The Russian revolutionary
movement has been used to failures and temporary collapses, the
organizations have been destroyed and abolished many a time, and yet
like a Ph&oelig;nix they would arise from out the ashes and manifest their significant
existence again and again. The cause, to all appearances, lies with
the modernized system applied by the bureaucracy in its war with the people&mdash;the
demoralization of the people. What Nicolas I. could not attain
through his iron despotism; what Alexander III. failed to accomplish by
means of crudest oppressions and restrictions carried through by such arch-tyrants
as Pobyedonostzev, D. Tolstoy, Muravyov, etc.; what had been
beyond the reach of Nicolas II. during the dictatorships of his genial assistants
of the type of Plehve, the hero of Kishinev, or General Trepov, the
man of Bloody Sunday (January, 1905),&mdash;this important point was won
by the gentleman-butcher, the hangman in the frock-coat, the late premier
Stolypin. The credit for having succeeded in breaking the spirit of the
nation and for having brought it to the verge of demoralization is largely
due to his policy.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish a <em>coup d&rsquo;état</em>, to abolish the Douma and reinstall the old
order of things, was the easiest attainable measure for Stolypin at the time
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
of his appointment to the highest post in the state. The opposition was
silenced by military force, the servile European financiers renewed their
enormous credit to the &ldquo;pacified&rdquo; Czardom which had been on the brink of
bankruptcy, and it seemed an obvious step to declare <em>urbi et orbi</em> the successful
restoration of the ancient autocracy. But Mr. Stolypin was a politician
of Bismarck&rsquo;s school. He loathed the laurels of a Pyrrhic victory.
The rich experience of his ill-famed predecessors had taught him that the
more harshly he suppressed the opposition the deeper it would grow and
develop in the &ldquo;Underground&rdquo;; that the closer he stopped up the yawning
crater the more intense and terrible would be the inevitable explosion. A
complete return to the old regime would again unite the entire nation within
and the civilized world from without in common hatred for the outworn
Asiatic despoty. Instead the shrewd premier chose the old Cæsarean maxim,
<em>Divide et impera</em>.
</p>

<p>
To incite racial hatred among the heterogeneous strata of the one hundred
and thirty millions population; to provoke the meanest mob instincts
and to flatter the lowest chauvinistic sentiments; to create mutual ill feelings
in all ranks of society by various provocative means; to incarnate espionage
in the national life as a virtue; to corrupt and prostitute all state institutions,
so as to kill every sense of confidence in the mercenary justice and respect
for all authorities; to arrest intellectual progress by barring and banishing
the best professors, by forbidding enlightenment organizations, by distracting
young minds from social problems through unscrupulous patronage of
nationalistic societies in the high schools and universities, of &ldquo;easy amusements&rdquo;
and all but clean sports; to augment crude force to the degree of
absolute right and sole law,&mdash;these have been the chief strategic measures
of the modernized absolutism.
</p>

<p>
It is true that a similar course, although on a considerably smaller scale,
has been pursued by the Russian government all through the nineteenth
century. The originality of Stolypin&rsquo;s methods and of those of his less
original successors lies in their up-to-dateness, their quasi-modernism, their
pseudo-constitutionalism, their hypocritical jesuitism. Actually Russia represents
the same old Asiatic despotism as of olden days. Officially, however,
it wears with a clumsy awkwardness the European frock-coat of parliamentarism.
It is a modern Janus, with an artificial human expression towards
the outside world, and with its natural primitive bestial front at home.
</p>

<p>
The Douma, the long-cherished ideal of the people, was transformed
from a house of representatives into an ante-room of the government, into
a shameful profanation of parliamentarism. The first two Doumas gave
an overwhelming opposition to the government, and the latter found an easy
way to get rid of its disagreeable opponents by dissolving the Assemblies
and suing the deputies as rebels. The unscrupulous Senate issued a series
of &ldquo;modifications&rdquo; to the electoral laws, and thus insured for the later
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
Doumas a &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; element. Having deprived the majority of the populace
of voting rights, giving all means of assistance and protection to the
&ldquo;Black Hundreds&rdquo;&mdash;criminal societies flourishing under the standard of
patriotism, terrifying the average voter and driving him into political
absenteeism, the government succeeded in gaining a majority of obsequious
manikins who have sold the people for a pottage of lentils and have debased
the Douma to a purely instrumental force in the hands of Stolypin &amp; Co.
</p>

<p>
Even the moderate liberals of the type of Professor Paul Milyoukov or
Prince Eugene Troubetzkoy, who have been ardent supporters of the Douma
as a means of educating the people on constitutional ideas,&mdash;even they are
gradually losing their rosy expectations. Representative Maklakov, a man
to whom even the late Stolypin, his bitterest antagonist, paid the highest
respect, in his report on the Douma cried in despair: &ldquo;One could have hoped
that the Douma was useless. Alas! It is getting harmful.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="VI">

<p class="noindent">
About a year ago the writer of these lines thus summarized the &ldquo;Contemporaneous
Russian Nihilism&rdquo;:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The bureaucracy celebrates its victory over the people. The heretofore united
forces are divided, the sacred ideal polluted, the bitterly-fought-for constitution
brought down to a mocking buffonade, and the &ldquo;Mighty Ham,&rdquo; whose coming was
predicted a few years ago by the illustrious Merezhkovski, has his day in the degradated
country. The Russian giant who had temporarily awakened after a slumber
of centuries, snores again hopelessly. Over the vast continent reigns a suffocating
atmosphere of despair, decay, and demoralization. A thick fog of nihilism, not the
Nihilism of Turgenyev&rsquo;s times, but nihilism in its direct negative meaning, enwraps
the martyred land of the Czar, and one can hardly discern a bright spot on the cloudy
horizon.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
In the past year the &ldquo;cloudy horizon&rdquo; has slightly brightened. Grave
symptoms have appeared in the seemingly calm atmosphere which suggested
Vereshchagin&rsquo;s <em>All is Quiet on Shipka</em>. Notwithstanding the strict
censorship of dispatches one could easily discern from the news items that
the volcano has not been extinguished yet. True, the orgy of the reactionary
forces has not abated; freedom of spoken and written word is still a myth;
the majority of the Douma is &ldquo;a trillion times blacker than black&rdquo;&mdash;to use
a Bodenheimesque figure; the revolutionary organizations are dragging a
pitiful existence in the underground, and the average citizen is still seeking
safety from the cossack&rsquo;s knout in phlegmatic splein. Yet signs of gratifying
unrest have been manifestly displayed of late in various camps of the
Empire. The rapidly developing capitalistic class has come to realize the
deadening effect of the bureaucratic regime on industry and commerce, and
resolutions have been passed at numerous conventions of manufacturers,
bankers, and other big business-men, condemning the stifling policy of the
archaic government. The tragicomedy of the Beilis process which revealed
the puerile helplessness of the rotten State justice, has united all cultured
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
Russia in a tremendous protest against the existing order; lawyers, journalists,
physicians, artists, teachers, and men of other liberal professions,
signed fiery resolutions whose <em>leit-motif</em> was Chekhov&rsquo;s sad verdict&mdash;&ldquo;Such
life is impossible!&rdquo; The unrest among the army, and particularly among
the navy, has had a great symptomatic significance. Multitudinous arrests
among soldiers and sailors, sporadic trials of revolutionary military organizations,
frequent transportations and transfers of regiments and vessels,
declaration of martial law in some important ports,&mdash;such have been the
albatrosses of the oncoming storm. After the crash of the proletarian
uprising of 1905 the remnants of the revolutionists have concentrated all
their forces against the stanchest citadel of Czardom&mdash;the army and the
navy, justly considering that only a military <em>coup d&rsquo;état</em> could change things
in present day Russia. The situation became definitely threatening last July,
during the visit of President Poincaré, when the Russian proletariat, defying
all manners and <em>bon ton</em> towards &ldquo;allied France,&rdquo; suddenly and unexpectedly
marred the display of friendly demonstrations by an epidemic outburst
of general strikes in St. Petersburg (or <em>must</em> we, by order of Nicolas
II., say&mdash;Petrograd?) and in other metropolises.
</p>

<p>
Amidst these pregnant preludes burst out the war bomb. For the
tottering absolutism it came most timely as the saving trump. Whether we
believe the press informations about the mad wave of patriotism overflowing
Russia or not, there can be no doubt that in view of the threatening national
catastrophy internal differences will lose their keenness and will give way to
easily drummed-up imperial solidarity, as far as the average citizens are
concerned. The uncompromising revolutionists will hardly have a considerable
following, especially when we consider the fact that the Czar has
been showing surprising tact and foresight of late by granting concessions
to his subjects and lavishly extending tempting promises to the oppressed
nationalities. The constantly humiliated and insulted citizen; the empoverished
overtaxed moujik; the flogged workingman; the bleeding, robbed,
deprived-of-rights Pole, Finn, Armenian, Caucasian, Jew, Lithuanian, Little-Russian,&mdash;all
these elements that make up the abstraction &ldquo;Russia&rdquo;
would have to possess a great deal of optimism in order to take seriously
the spasmodic ejaculations of the drowning &ldquo;Little Father&rdquo; who has beaten
the world&rsquo;s record as a perjurer. Yet one need not be a specialist in mass
psychology to predict the success of Nicholas&rsquo;s bait. We may further
prophesy that, whatever the outcome of the war, Russia will emerge purged
and electrified, stirred and volcanized. Surely, &ldquo;such life,&rdquo; pre-war life,
will be &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;

Timidly her purple wings unfolded in the kind warmth of the sun.
When they had grown strong, she began to flutter hither and thither, from
flower to flower, a wingéd dream flitting as perfumes called her, from
dream to dream.

At last, when the dark fingers of the night were clutching at the fields,
from the brief stillness of twilight arose a brief summer storm. Only a few
puffs of wind ruffled the grass, only a few growls of thunder silenced the
birds, only a few warm drops of rain pattered among the trees. Then
the storm passed and the sun shone over the wet earth as a sweetheart shines
through her tears with promise of pardon.
</p>

<p>
But the warm wind had blown the butterfly against a twig, so that her
wings were broken; and the soft summer rain had crushed her to the earth,
so that she died. But there had been one passing, whose dreams were in
music, and he had felt her beauty in his own. And he spun a web of harmony
from the rainbow of his sorrow and the skeins of her beauty, so that
men who had lost their dreams were snared in his net, and women whose
hearts were buried wept for the death of a butterfly....

<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">nce</span> upon a time, in a certain secret city of the East, lived a woman
who was a sorceress. And she awaited tidings of great joy or tidings of
terrible sorrow.
</p>

<p>
All day long, from her housetop, she had peered across the desert,
seeking the messenger who did not come. At nightfall her servants returned
to her with rumors gathered in the market place. With rumors of sorrow
they returned and stood in a row before her with averted faces.
</p>

<p>
When she had heard their fears, she thanked them, and going down
from the housetop, she sought a hidden chamber where she could be alone
and silent. When she had pondered for awhile, she piled rare herbs in a
brazier, and wet them with strange liquors, and touched fire to them. The
flames flickered and smoked, singing a soft happy little song all to themselves.
But she could read no answer in the singing, and no meaning in
the coils of smoke; and she was very sad. At last, with a despairing gesture,
she took certain secret things from the chest whereof she alone had
the key, and those things she laid upon the fire and watched until they were
consumed.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the embers were cold and gray, she took from the carven
chest a vial of jade and a jade cup. From the vial she poured out a pale
green potion, and raising the cup in her hands, she drank it to the end. Then
she lay down upon the marble couch. In a little while she slept.

A sweet, heavy vapor rose from the cup, filling the room with perfume.
The dregs glowed with dull evil light, for the potion had been poison, and

unless it is in a position to justify and verify itself to the moral and rational
judgment of mankind. In our time of day, what is church, what is state,
what are society and law and sanctified custom&mdash;things that the old reformation
partly inherited, partly organized, and wholly bequeathed to us?
At best, tones for the musician&rsquo;s use, clay in the hands of the potter, or
stuff for the sculptor&rsquo;s shaping, materials all, ductile or refractory, to be
kneaded into forms for the habitation of man&rsquo;s free spirit, man&rsquo;s soul,
man&rsquo;s life. This critical spirit of an all-inclusive reform of life, to which
everything belonging to life is subject, for which science works and art as
well, living and active in the heart of modern humanity in countless problems,
like the woman problem, the labor problem, like national and international
social problems, with all their subdivisions,&mdash;this critical spirit
gives our time a prophetic character. It summons all progressive spirits
to the great struggle against a common foe, against all those forces which
have banded together for a standstill of life and have made a lucrative
and social-climbing business out of retrogression.
</p>

<p>
Can there be any doubt as to the stand we ought to take with reference
to these great movements? May we not greet them as a new spring-time
of humanity whose light and warmth shall vanquish winter, and bring
life, joy and peace into the land? &ldquo;When the Day of Passover was fully
Come&rdquo;&mdash;may we not see this day in these movements, when a spirit of truth
and soul and freedom shall brood over men, and lead them to higher
goals and greater tasks of human being?
</p>

<p>
To be sure, our era is not arbitrarily made, not excogitated and invented
by man. To be sure, great elementary forces of life will come, must
come, to their unfolding in these movements. To be sure, the matter of
real concern is a new structure of humanity, new cultural and social forms,
new world-views, new life-views. No doubt these forces of life will carry
the individual along with them, will come upon him and coerce him when
he does not so will, will not at all even ask him what he wills, what he
has to say to them, or how he regards them. But on this very account,
in surveying the great whole of our life development we easily lose sense
for what is individual and special. Where classes and masses of men encounter
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
each other, where world-moving thought jolt and undermine thousand-year-old
traditions and customs, removing their very foundations,
there the individual human soul suffers abridgement, there we forget that
even the largest number consists of units, and that the greatest numerical
worth is judged according to the worth of these units.
</p>

<p>
Therefore a great social thinker must reflect ever anew that <em>man</em> is the
significant thing in every new social culture&mdash;is beginning and goal. To
understand how to trumpet a word respecting <em>man and his personality</em> into
this social movement and seething, this is to do an essential service to the
modern way of viewing life, this is to warn us that we are not entirely
impersonal in the presence of pure objectivity.
</p>

<p>
No one has done such service to our age in so signal a manner, as
<em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em>. He is not the preacher of <em>social</em>, but of <em>personal</em>, man.
However, fundamental hater of socialism that he was, he yet became a
mighty moving and impelling force for socialism. He, too, wills a new
culture, <em>but he wills it through a new man</em>. Therefore, he shows us the
way to this new culture in that which is most <em>personal</em> to man, in man&rsquo;s
<em>Longing</em>, or yearning, or craving,&mdash;in man&rsquo;s <em>Sehnsucht</em>,&mdash;a word of profound
import to which none of these English words does justice.
</p>

<p>
To many ears that program does not sound provocative, promising,
alluring. <em>Sehnsucht</em> is not a feeling that makes one happy and blissful&mdash;not
a feeling to which one would like to accord a constant and abiding possession
of one&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Only he who knows <em>Sehnsucht</em> knows what I <em>suffer</em>&rdquo;&mdash;so
sighed Goethe&rsquo;s Mignon, one of the most impressive and marvelous
characters the poet-genius ever created, an Incarnate Yearning, self-consumed
in unquieted longing of soul, in <em>Heimweh</em> for a dreamily visioned
distance, to walk in whose sunny beauty her feet were never destined. To
preach <em>Sehnsucht</em> is to preach hunger. To hunger is to ache. The gnawing
of a hungry stomach&mdash;but what is that compared with the gnawing of a
hungry heart, when everything that seems good and great and worth striving
after becomes elusive, unattainable, unintelligible, to passionate longing?
<em>Sehnsucht</em> is not anxiety, it is worse than anxiety. Anxiety is petty; <em>Sehnsucht</em>
is great and deep. In anxiety, life is dark, and darkness terrifies and
distresses man. In <em>Sehnsucht</em>, life is luminous, but the light blinds the soul.
<em>Sehnsucht</em> sees all light in a magical radiance, yet cannot clasp it; feels its
overpowering attraction, yet cannot satisfy the eye with it. Prometheus
chained to a rock, after he had filched the celestial spark from the gods!
Tantalus, the luscious fruit just over his head, but wafted away as soon as
he longs to grasp it with greedy hands! Yes, all the human heart&rsquo;s deepest
pain, this is <em>Sehnsucht</em>. Whoever names a pain that is not <em>Sehnsucht</em> has not
peered to the bottom of pain&rsquo;s chalice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Woe to that man through whom <em>Sehnsucht</em> comes!&rdquo; we might almost
cry. If you love me, do not stir up this yearning for the impossible that is
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
in me, this hot, fervent craving, which can never find satisfaction, which
can never enjoy the pleasures of life, or its own self. If you love men, save
them from their very youth up in the presence of that tempestuous storm
and stress into the Afar, where all solid shores vanish, all safe harbors are
closed&mdash;save men, trembling, untranquil, from the everlasting question:
Knowest thou the land? Knowest it well? Leave men their peace of mind,
add no fuel to the flame of their discontent. Do not wrong them by letting
them eat of the tree of knowledge. Do not show them the infinite expanse
unrolling behind and beyond the narrow confines of their petty lives, thus
spoiling the pleasure of their contentment, the joy they have in their limited
and longingless life. Paradise is better than Wilderness. The familiar murmur
of the brook in the meadow by the old home is more restful than the
roar of the cataract or than the eternal haunting mystery and melody of the
great sea. Such is the common cry of the lackadaisical, the longingless, the
<em>laissez-faire</em> people to all of us who &ldquo;turn the world upside down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, we make all men sufferers&mdash;we who pilot their minds to what is
not yet there, and to what they not yet are&mdash;we who show them a land
lying undiscovered in mist or azure ahead of them. We make man seekers,
we become disturbers of the peace&mdash;this is what they call our crime and
blasphemy. Therefore, men give us a wide berth, warn others against our
society, afraid of the yearning and hot hunger of soul which would come
over them, were they once to hanker after a different fare from what they
light upon in their troughs every morning, gorging themselves to an easy
satiety&mdash;a different fare that would make them hunger ever anew, and arouse
them to new longings. No, comfort men; free them from their painful
Sehnsucht; teach them the foolishness of hitching their wagons to stars; tell
them that all is well with them and make them content with any lot in life
that may by chance be theirs! Then you will be their true benefactors; then
you will heal the wounds from which the heart would otherwise so easily
bleed!
</p>

<p>
Really? That is a good thing to do for men? The wise thing to say
to the heart is: Break your wings in two, so you will not be tempted to
brave the blue, to keep company with &ldquo;the distant sea,&rdquo; to explore the Afar?
The comforting thing to do for the slave is to gild his chains, so that he
may have joy in their glittering splendor and show them off as worth their
weight in gold? How easy it would be then for the Czar of all the Russias
&ldquo;to go to Berlin if it costs me my last peasant!&rdquo; How easy for the Vatican
to silence the modernist! Throne and altar, an <em>entente cordiale</em> indeed, could
then enjoy by &ldquo;divine right&rdquo; an unmolested and unworried repose upon a
world of dumb, blind, brute peasants. But&mdash;

Why did God implant <em>Sehnsucht</em> in the heart of man? &ldquo;Thou hast
made us for Thyself and the heart is restless until it rests in Thee,&rdquo; said
Augustine long ago. Indeed, God is but another human name for Eternal
Yearning.
</p>

<p>
All yearning is love&mdash;love that silently and secretly celebrates its triumphal
entry into the soul. If you stood at the grave of a joy and felt
pain over that which was lost, would not the pain of yearning be the
measure, the consciousness, of your newly-awakened, ever-waking love?
Would you like to calculate this yearning and exchange therefor coldness
and indifference of heart? And if you felt a love so full and deep that
moments had eternities concealed in them, even so, on the basis of this love
yearning would live more than ever, it would open up to the soul new vistas,
new goals, it would give love her life; and a love without yearning, which
did not see beyond itself, did not love above itself, finished in that which it
was, or it called its own&mdash;would quickly cease to be love. Yes, yearning
redoubles all genuine love to man; it involves something becoming, something
greater, purer, for which love lays the foundation and gives the impulse.
Only he who knows yearning, knows what I <em>love</em>, so Mignon might
have also said. There is something unslaked, unslakable, in every love, an
insatiable hunger for more love, for better and purer love.
</p>

<p>
It is this yearning that saves love from being blind; it gives love the
strength and courage of veraciousness; it plunges the heart into a struggle
of desperation when a man of our love does not keep his promise, when he
becomes pettier and baser than we had believed of him; and yet in this
struggle it achieves the victory of faith which mounts above all the pettiness
and baseness of the man, to the certainty of its strength, that love
faileth never. In every love we love something higher than itself, something
for which the heart is destined and endowed. This is the yearning
in our love, <em>a will</em>, which stirs in all deep feeling of the heart, and guards
against the death which every moment, sufficient only for itself, harbors.
Every love, therefore, is itself a yearning: love for truth is the power to
grow beyond <em>a</em> truth; love for righteousness is hunger and thirst after
righteousness. In all the beauty that greets the eye and awakens exultation
and joy in the heart, the soul ripens new sensitivity for new visions of
the wonders of life, the heart widens so that it absorbs strength for new
beauty and sees new beauty even in the darkness and dust of earth. A man
without yearning is a man without love. And if one would guarantee man
that satisfaction which one prizes as the most beautiful and most blissful
lot on earth, then one must first stifle his heart or tear it from his breast;
for as long as this heart still beats, and announces in every beat its insatiable
hunger for love, so long will the man harbor and feel his yearning,
which will not let the beating heart be satisfied.
</p>

<p>
But yearning is therefore not simply suffering, not simply love&mdash;of these
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
we have been thinking&mdash;it is also life, the true life of man. The man who
lives only for himself, and for the passing moment, does not live at all.
And this is what Nietzsche says of man&mdash;man a transition and an end&mdash;yearning
always interring an Old, always swinging a bridge across to a
New&mdash;love loving the most distant and most future&mdash;vision sweeping up
the ages to higher man. This, then, is man&rsquo;s hour of great self-contempt.
All his happiness, his wealth, his knowledge, his virtue, seems too little to
fill his soul. There is insufficiency, nausea, as to all that he esteems, a
cry of wrath from the deep of his being, a cry that sounds like madness
to all who call themselves good and righteous, to all who call their execrable
smugness a delight.
</p>

<p>
But this is the great tumultuous yearning, the thunder of whose soaring
wings is forever in modern ears. It proffers man a new table of values;
forward, not backward, shall he look; love <em>Kinderland</em>, the undiscovered
land in distant oceans, that he may make amends to the children for <a id="corr-6"></a>their
being the children of their fathers!
</p>

<p>
In this song of jubilee of yearning, who does not hear the old ring,
which was once preached as glad tidings, as gospel of humanity! There,
too, it was the seeking that were saved, the hungering and not the sated,
the starving and not the full. And they, too, had their Higher Man&mdash;the
Christ they called Him, their Yearning, their Love, their Life. They
sang: For me to live is Christ; I live, yet not I; Christ lives in me. And
as long as this Yearning lived in them, they were creative spirits. They put
a new face upon the world. They transformed the world after the image
of their Higher Man. A living, a socially organized Yearning, this is what
the whole Middle Age was, with its Below and its Above, where each lower
man had in each higher man a rung of the heavenly ladder on which he
should climb to a higher existence. A yearning hewn in stone, that was
their dome; yearning they sang in their most impressive hymns and masses;
and yearning breathed all those celestial figures as they lifted their glorified
eyes to the Higher Man of Heaven, the Man Thorn-crowned, Crucified and
Risen.
</p>

<p>
Then the glow of this yearning was cooled by the cold north wind of
reality. Yearning petrified. There was no inclination to keep it from dying.
They were swift to deal it a deadly blow. They thought they had accomplished
marvels to have torn themselves <a id="corr-7"></a>loose from it. &ldquo;No more <em>Sehnsucht</em>
now,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;for we have found happiness!&rdquo; They smirked and
they blinked. Their Higher Man died along with their yearning. The
scholars indeed had discovered that this Higher Man was only &ldquo;man,&rdquo; a
Jewish rabbi whom the people of his day mistakenly held to be a Higher
Man, a Messiah, but who now to them themselves and to all moderns belongs
to Lower Man, to Past Man. To be sure, it goes against the grain of all of
them for their Higher Man to vanish from life, from the yearning of man.
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
Therefore, they seek painfully and anxiously for a &ldquo;Dignity&rdquo; which they
may still claim for their <em>human</em> Jesus. Above all, they thus forget that the
Higher Man can never lie behind us, but only before us, not beside us,
on a level with us, but only above us. Therefore, all their scholarship cannot
rescue the Higher Man for us, and cannot give us back the Great Yearning.
Only the living heart can do this, the heart that creates out of its own mystery
a yearning. That heart with this yearning will overcome and retire
the man of today&mdash;all who play the game as lords of today. The modern
man of yearning looks beyond himself, works beyond himself, for a Man
as high above present-day man as once the <em>Christusbild</em> was above the men
of the long-lost past&mdash;a Man who will bear all the deeps of the world and
all the deeps of its woes in his heart, while at the same time thirsting in its
deepest depths for the eternities. This great yearning, this suffering and
loving yearning, this is more than all the wisdom of the scribes, all the
subtleties and hairsplittings of the theologians, this is the sacred womb
from which a Christ life is born ever and ever again. &ldquo;Only he who knows
yearning, knows what I <em>live</em>!&rdquo;&mdash;so might Mignon&rsquo;s dear words be changed
yet again. To save the Sehnsucht is to save the soul. <em>Also sprach Goethe&mdash;Nietzsche!</em>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne</span> does not know quite how the modern literary movement in Vienna
arose. Suddenly, some twenty years ago, there were some active young
writers called &ldquo;Young Vienna,&rdquo; in a collective way, who were supposed to
be revolutionary and bent on originality. In reality these young people had
no definite literary program such as had been issued in Berlin by the
leaders of the new naturalist movement. They were a circle of friends, who
had heard of the new and wonderful things that had been done. They came
to know Ibsen and the great Russian and French novelists; they were of the
generation which was to be moved to the utmost by the philosophy of
Nietzsche. Of course these influences had been working in the whole German-speaking
world. Art was being taken seriously again and the young
people were yearning to produce something new and original of their own.
</p>

<p>
Hauptmann had started a kind of revolution in Germany by his first
play, <em>Before Sunrise</em>, and the Viennese, who lived a little isolated in their
town, grew excited and enthusiastic over these doings.
</p>

<p>
A young writer, Hermann Bahr, was a kind of apostle for the new art
in Vienna. He was a man of agility, capable of unbounded enthusiasm, who
could go into ecstasy for all kinds of movements&mdash;for realism as well as
neo-romanticism, for Ibsen and Zola, for Maeterlinck and d&rsquo;Annunzio. He
had been traveling about in Europe, had come in touch with all the leading
personalities, and had brought the news home to his Viennese friends; he
wanted to make a new Vienna in every way. A few years later he was active
in organizing the young painters, sculptors, and architects, who evolved a
very original and striking art.
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that Hermann Bahr was considered the leader of
everything modern&mdash;which meant &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; to the good citizen of the day. It
was this same milieu of the citizen, the bourgeois, that produced all the
young writers. In consequence, they were absolutely anti-bourgeois in their
way of looking at things, in the very natural contrast of fathers and sons.
Hence, too, they had a certain culture, good manners, and a predominant
interest in æsthetic questions, as there had been no occasion for them to
know the primitive cares of life. But they were tired of the narrowness and
tastelessness of their milieu; they wanted to do things differently&mdash;to live
and love differently; to put art into their surroundings, their dwellings, their
dress; good taste&mdash;this had been a tradition of the old Vienna, lost in the
transition-state when the middle-class element obtained its precedence over
the old aristocracy&mdash;was now to take its place again.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the dislike of these Viennese young men for the bourgeoisie
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
there were really very few positive tendencies that could join them into a
group. Consequently very different artistic individualities developed. Arthur
Schnitzler and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, the two most representative, have
very little in common in their work. But there was a spirit of friendship
among all of them; they liked to meet in the cafés, which had always been
Vienna&rsquo;s center of social life, and to talk things over&mdash;the lightest and the
deepest. A certain café used to be famous as the center of the young literary
world. The old people who didn&rsquo;t like the whole business called it the café
of the crazy self-worshippers (something to that effect), and this title has
stuck to it since. Today, the house has been demolished, its glory has
passed, but there are still legends and stories told of the wonderful talk,
the hot and breathless debates that once filled these rooms from morning till
night&mdash;and till morning again.
</p>

<p>
In all this there was no real rebellion against any local literary tradition.
The great Austrian writers of the past always held their own places;
but the great dramatists did not reign on the stage of that day. It was
nearly exclusively devoted to the French salon-play&mdash;Dumas, Augier, and
their German imitators. Naturally a generation which looked for the true
and real in art could not have much in common with these.
</p>

<p>
But there were certainly some features in Grillparzer and Anzengruber
felt as congenial by the moderns. Grillparzer had possessed a sensuous softness,
a musical beauty of language foreign to the contemporary North German.
Thus an element of color and light&mdash;the soul of modern impressionism&mdash;entered
in his creations, breaking through the severe contours characteristic
of his generation, though in general he set great value on the strict
architectonic upbuild of his dramas. In his tragedy of <em>Hero and Leander</em>
perhaps the warmest love tragedy ever written in the German language, a
strongly realistic description of Viennese type is hidden among the Greek
clothing. Hero, consecrated priestess, who forgets her vows when she sees
Leander, first full of reserve, then letting herself go in a full passion, might
be the grandmother of Schnitzler&rsquo;s sweet girl out of the suburb. Here she
wears a charming Greek dress, her lonely tower stands on the seashore, and
her lover, Leander, must swim through the whole Hellespont to reach her.
The modern poet makes it easier for his heroes; the tower gets to be a little
room in a Viennese suburb and a walk in the twilight through a few quiet
streets brings him to his goal without much exertion. (And so you might
find other parental traits between the two Austrians.)
</p>

<p>
There is a melancholy strain in Grillparzer&rsquo;s personality and work which
Schnitzler seems to have inherited. Side by side with the light-mindedness
and ease of the Austrian, a certain tired melancholy and resignation seem to
dwell. This sounds through many creations of Austrian artists. We hear
it in Schubert&rsquo;s music and feel it in the charming plays of Ferdinand Plaimund,
who saw the harmony only in an upper sphere of fairies and magicians,
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
whereas the life of the human beings seemed tumultuous and disordered to
him.
</p>

<p>
Austria did not make it easy for her gifted children, and Grillparzer
suffered all his life in his official career. It oppressed him and warped his
creative power. Ludwig Anzengruber had to suffer under the same disadvantages,
but he had a greater fund of good humor to set against it. He
was a man of vigor and <em>lebensbejahung</em> (affirmation of life). Anzengruber
was called the herald of naturalism and the Berlin people counted him as
one of their number, producing his plays together with those of Ibsen and
Hauptmann on the Berlin Free Stage.
</p>

<p>
Anzengruber applied the heightened sense for reality characteristic of
modern art&mdash;be it called naturalistic or neo-romantic&mdash;to his own work and
introduced a new material to the drama. The peasant story had been treated
up to now in a moralizing way. The idyl of country innocence was to be
shown and towns-people were to see the purer heart&rsquo;s sentiment under the
dirtier shirts. Anzengruber showed the peasants in their reality, neither
better nor worse. His fingers are unnatural and stiff in representing types
of the cultured classes speaking the literary German; his peasant types are
of wonderful vitality. There is the old stone-cutter who has thought out a
deep pantheistic philosophy. He relates it in his simple way: how it all
came to him&mdash;how he was lonely, poor, lying in his cottage up in the mountains,
how he saw the sun lying on the meadow and wanted to live in the
sunshine, not in his miserable hut when he felt near dying. And then, out in
the sunny meadow, it comes to him like a revelation that he is not really ill,
not really poor, because nothing can happen to him&mdash;because everything
around belongs to him and he belongs to everything. This deep pantheistic
feeling expressed in this unpathetic way gives him from now on a perfect
good humor not to be disturbed. He goes among the peasants looking on at
their quarrelings and grumblings and helps them out of their worst plights
in a good-natured way, but without bothering them in the least with his
philosophy or any tendency toward improving them or the world in general.
</p>

<p>
Anzengruber, with such religious views as he expressed here, had to be
opposed to the Catholicism in which he was brought up. He fights against
the clericalism which was weighing so heavily on the peasants. He could
feel their needs, for, though he was born in Vienna and lived there nearly
all his life, there was more country than town blood in his veins. This connects
him closer with Hauptmann, the Silesian, so deeply influenced in his
art by home environment, than with any of the young Austrian writers who
were all born in the big towns and did not know what firm rooting in the
soil means. Anzengruber&rsquo;s traditions could not be followed by them and
there is the greatest contrast between his strong energetic work and the
dainty, tender, delicate things produced by Schnitzler as the first product of
the young Viennese school just a year after Anzengruber&rsquo;s death. This was
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
<em>Anatol</em>, a little work full of grace, charm, and playfulness. The loose way
in which the seven scenes were connected only by Anatol&rsquo;s figure was perfectly
original. It was really nothing but little sketches put into dialogues
characteristic of Vienna, the town whose special glamour consist in the
dialogue of ordinary conversation; the pretty chat of the drawing room, the
café raised to the dignity of a fine art; and with all this, having a lightness,
a delicacy, a frothiness, a wit, and a quality of sadness not found anywhere
else.
</p>

<p>
Women&rsquo;s influence penetrated this art&mdash;in Austria just as in the Latin
countries the cult of women had always been a factor of culture and with
this generation of poets her triumphal epoch started. She was put into the
center. It was written around her and it was written for her. <em>Anatol</em>
belongs to those, for our days, improbable beings who only live for love;
erotics are his sole occupation, his only profession. But he is not the victorious
Don Juan full of self-confidence; he is rather quiet, with a shade of
agreeable modesty,&mdash;a melancholic of love, he calls himself.

The young Hofmannsthal wrote an introduction to the work of his
friend in dainty verses. They expressed the spirit of this art extremely well,
so I will quote them partly, though it would require an artist to translate
them in good form. He says:
</p>

The sense of reality, which had been acquired in the school of Zola and
Ibsen, was used here to make travels of discovery into the most interesting
and unknown land of all&mdash;the over soul. And here the complicated, the
unusual inmoods and feelings and emotions fascinated the young artists.
Personality itself, though the center, took rather a passive part,&mdash;it simply
came to be the scene of action, the meeting-place of all different impressions.
People of the earlier time had been expressionists who projected their own
ego into the outward world, whereas now they held themselves open to new
impressions, observed them and their effect on the <em>I</em> and then reproduced
their observations in artistic form. Impressionism, predominant in painting
at that time, had taken hold of literature. Of course, this passivity could
only be a stage of transition, because each artistic individuality tends from
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
the passive to the active; but this impressionism was a good means of
assimilating all the new possibilities in the inside and outside world.
</p>

<p>
Schnitzler, born as the son of a famous Viennese physician, and prepared
to be a physician himself, was trained to observe. He had a sure
scientific eye for human problems, a kind, objective benevolence, and tender
forbearance for all sides of human life.
</p>

<p>
<em>Anatol</em>, his first work, is typical of all the following. Here we see the
principal figures, the complicated lover as hero, a friend as the <em>raisonneur</em>,&mdash;a
remembrance of the French play,&mdash;and seven different types of womanhood.
Here they all are&mdash;the simple sweet girl, loving with her whole heart;
the woman, who loves to play with men; the lady of the world, she who
would like to love, but has not courage to do it.
</p>

<p>
The long line of his dramas, novels, and novelettes&mdash;for he tried to
express himself in all these forms&mdash;all speak of love and death. For the
pathetic element soon creeps into Anatol&rsquo;s frivolousness. The presentiment of
the transitory dwells in his creation&mdash;the end of love, the end of enjoyment
and of passion, the end of life itself. But this permanent thought of death,
not searching beyond the limits of this earth, gives a new intensity to the
enjoyment of this life while it lasts. This feeling for life, for the simple
joy of breathing, of seeing the spring once more, is one of Schnitzler&rsquo;s most
elementary conceptions. You may look at any of his plays and find this
true&mdash;the call of Life, expressed with the utmost intensity. A young girl
hears the call of life&mdash;she is fettered to the bedside of her ill father who
never lets her out of his sight. She must stay with him&mdash;always&mdash;without
the smallest pleasure, and suddenly she hears that the man she loves, a young
officer whom she has seen only once, when she has danced in his arms a
whole night long, must away to the war never to return. She can stand it
no longer; she gives her father poison, the whole sleeping potion, and
rushes away to him who is her only thought. And now events go in a mad
rush; she in his room, unknown to himself, hidden behind a curtain, she sees
the woman he loves, the beautiful wife of his colonel, come to him. She
wants him to stay away from the war, save his life for her sake, and then
suddenly the colonel stands between the two and shoots down his wife. The
officer he leaves to judge himself. Over the corpse of the other woman
the girl rushes into the arms of the man, who can belong to her for the few
hours left to him. And after all these breathless events, she remains alone,
bewildered, as if after a heavy dream. She lives on and cannot understand
that there is still room for her in the world, with all her crime and grief and
joy. But a wise and kind friend explains the connection and wins her over
to life once more. These are his words&mdash;the drama&rsquo;s conclusion: &ldquo;You <em>live</em>,
Marie, and it was. Since that night too and that morning, the days and
nights go on for you. You walk through field and meadow. You pluck the
wayside flowers and you talk with me here under the bright, friendly, midday
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
sky. And this is living&mdash;not less than it was on that night when your
darkened youth beckoned you toward gloomy adventures, which still today
appear to you to be the last word of your being. And who knows, if later,
much later, on a day like today, the call of the living will not cry within you
much deeper, and purer, than on that day in which you have lived through
things which are called by such terrible and glowing names as murder and
love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The whole play seems to be written for the sake of the last beautiful
words. It is Schnitzler&rsquo;s greatest art to lift us to a sphere where everything
seemingly important is solved, where tragedy and melancholy and sadness
melt together into a wonderful serenity. His technique is full of subtlety;
every little word and gesture has its place, its importance; we feel the weight
of the smallest happening, the reality of a seemingly unmeaning fact, the
deep consequence of a hasty word.
</p>

<p>
The milieu was nearly always Vienna. Here his over-cultivated, refined
men were at home, here his soft and loving women. All the several
circles, aristocrats, artists, physicians, business men, furnished material for
his work; and even more than the people, the town itself grew to life. The
elegant vivaciousness of the inner city, where the fashionable society meets
at certain hours and fashionable little shops line the streets, the lonely little
streets of the suburb, the wonderful charm of the Wiener Wald embracing
the town with its soft rounded lines&mdash;all this rich flowering beauty that had
surrounded him from childhood he gathered in his work. Perhaps more
forcibly than any one else he brought Vienna&rsquo;s charm to our consciousness.
And so he returned to Vienna what he had received from her.
</p>

<p>
Only two of his plays are outside the Viennese milieu&mdash;<em>The Green
Cockatoo</em>, a grotesque that puts us marvelously well in the Parisian atmosphere
shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolution; and <em>Beatrice&rsquo;s
Veil</em>, a Renaissance drama which tempted almost every artist in those days.
This epoch&rsquo;s refinement, the powerful personalities peopling it, the intensity
concentrated on the enjoyment of their life&mdash;in all this they saw something
akin to their own life&rsquo;s ideal.
</p>

<p>
Schnitzler&rsquo;s plays have nothing of the fresco; they are more like Manet&rsquo;s
small landscapes with their richness of color and their soft contours diffused
in light.
</p>

<p>
He made one attempt at a drama in big, unusually big, dimensions. It
takes about six hours to perform on the stage, longer than the second part
of Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Faust</em>; it is a historic play of the Napoleonic time called <em>The
Young Medardus</em>, but the Emperor himself remains in the background and
only his shadow lies on the events. These take place in Vienna at the time
that Napoleon had reached Austria on his triumphal march and resided for
the time in Schonbrun, the Hapsburg&rsquo;s castle near Vienna. The
Viennese people as a mass are characterized&mdash;these people so easily moved, so
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
easily influenced, growing enthusiastic now for Napoleon, now in a hasty
patriotic emotion for their own Emperor, principally wanting one thing: to
see some exciting spectacle, to hear news, to speak over interesting happenings.
The broadest part of the drama is occupied by a love episode between
the hero Medardus&mdash;a cousin, if not a brother of Anatol, only about a hundred
years back&mdash;and the beautiful, proud, cold Duchess of Valois, who is
in Vienna to intrigue against Napoleon, claiming the right to the French
throne for herself and her own family. The work is full of beautiful and
interesting episodes, but there is not enough architectonic power to join them
together to a unity.
</p>

<p>
It is too early to view Schnitzler in a historic way&mdash;he is fifty years old
and in the middle of his work; certainly he signified much for his own generation,
for they felt themselves understood by him and he influenced and
even formed their attitude and feeling. Whether his figures have enough
of the timelessness, of the deep, full-rounded humanity which will give them
power to speak to future generations I do not know. In a mood of paradoxical
humor, Schnitzler himself criticised his own creation more severely than
any critic could. We see a marionettes&rsquo; theater on the stage; the public
there, eager for the play; the marionettes appear&mdash;all Schnitzler&rsquo;s own
figures: the complicated hero, the sweet girl, the demonic woman, and so on.
The poet is there, full of excitement. The marionettes are to give his new
play, but there is a rebellion. The marionettes want to do what
pleases them, live their <em>own life</em>. In the midst of confusion, a mysterious man
appears on the stage with a long naked sword in his hand; he cuts through
the threads; the marionettes fall in a heap. The poet asks, half grateful,
half bewildered, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; But the unknown man cannot tell him;
he is an enigma to himself. He wanders through the world and his sword
makes it apparent who only is a doll, who a man. Schnitzler doomed his
figures with more severity to the fate of dolls than is due them.
</p>

<p>
The second Viennese writer whose name became known beyond the
town&rsquo;s limits is Hugo von Hofmannsthal. He is a very different person
from Schnitzler; both have the sensitive, refined, exclusively aesthetic valuation
of things in common. But what was expressed more naively in Schnitzler
came to be a program with Hofmannsthal. He joined a group of men
with a strict &ldquo;Art for Art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; program, exclusive and intended only for
the few. The principal of this group was Stefan George, a lyric poet who
had fashioned the German language into poems of such beauty of form as
to rival the poetry of the French lyricists, like Baudelaire or Verlaine. It
was an art that irritated people somewhat, like that of the Cubists and Futurists.
It was extremely hard to understand; the sense organs were mixed up,
as he spoke of sounding colors, fragrant tones, and colored sounds. Hofmannsthal,
with a great feeling for language and form, grew to be his follower.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
These poets called themselves Neo-Romanticists, because their art was
crowded full of symbols. The older Ibsen, with his symbolic world, Maeterlinck,
with his mysterious little plays, were their models; with these the great
artists of form, Swinburne and d&rsquo;Annunzio. It was an eclectic, much-traveled
type, assimilating old and modern cultures equally well.
</p>

<p>
Hugo von Hofmannsthal is characteristic of the type of the aesthete,
with a rather priestly, exclusive bearing still found today frequently in Germany.
These were no more the old Bohemians with a preference for a deranged
toilette and way of living, but elegant young gentlemen who liked
to appear in frock coats with ties and waistcoats fabulously gay of color.
Also, in their surroundings their liking went to the utmost refinement and
luxury. They loved the dignified, the sensational, the sonorous. Hugo von
Hofmannsthal certainly blessed his parents for giving him a well-sounding,
sonorous name.
</p>

<p>
He had a great talent as a lyricist, and as an essayist, with the finest
understanding for all foreign cultures as long as they responded to something
in his own soul. His dramas are not in any way related to Vienna.
He perused all history&rsquo;s epochs and took the material for his dramas from
the Orient, out of the Italian Renaissance (his favorite epoch), and the
classic art of the Greek. Many of his plays are not intended as original creations,
but arrangements of older works. So he did with an old pre-Shakespearean
English play by Thomas Otway and with the old mystery play
<em>Everywoman</em>. Some of his little plays are lovely&mdash;the death of Titian gives
a vision of the dead extravagance of Venice equalled by few modern productions.
His most interesting attempt is an arrangement of <em>Elektra</em> for the
modern stage. His Greeks are barbarous, wild, full of unbroken primitive
instincts. They are under the influence of an extreme nervous hysteria.
Nietzsche had spoken of the Greek hysteria, which slumbered under their
apparent serenity. Hofmannsthal put a picture of horror on the stage that
keeps the spectator spellbound from the first to the last minute. Through
the concentration in one act this intensity is still increased.
</p>

<p>
Since Richard Strauss put <em>Elektra</em> into music, Hofmannsthal has devoted
his art entirely to this composer. His last works are written as libretti
for Strauss operas, and go through the world now in the wake of his music.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I would like to tell of a strange Viennese personality, no
dramatist, but just as little a novelist, epic or lyric poet. The name of this
man, who cannot be put into any of the ordinary literary compartments, is
Peter Altenberg. He thought that most of the things told in dramas of five,
or three, or only one act, were superfluous; the essential could be told in
three lines as a rule. He wishes to give the extract and the reader might
work it out for himself. He only writes very short sketches, apparently perfectly
usual things, out of every-day life. But he discovered a little secret,
<a id="cnt55"></a>namely, that the ordinary is really the most wonderful. Miracles do not
exist any more, but the miraculous is there, everywhere. <em>Fairy Tales of
Life</em> he calls one of his books (in which he collects a number of sketches);
but he might call them all by the same name. As in Maeterlinck&rsquo;s <em>Blue Bird</em>
the wonderful is everywhere, but we have not the eyes to see it. Well, Peter
Altenberg has these eyes. His little sketches would seem untranslatable.
They might seem, in a different language, perfectly banal little things, not
worth the relating,&mdash;but suddenly a veil is removed and we see the world
and things in a new light.
</p>

<p>
Peter Altenberg uses the most original style&mdash;one might call it a telegram
style; it is very abrupt without any endeavor at a connected literary
form. He wants, as he says himself, to describe a man in one sentence; an
event of the soul on one page; a landscape with one word.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in Vienna knows Peter Altenberg. He is a poet of the
street, who goes around and writes down his little sketches wherever he may
be&mdash;principally in the cafes.
</p>

<p>
All the women must love him&mdash;for he has sung their praises all his life,
like a minnesinger of the Middle Ages.

Goldman is to give a series of new lectures in the Assembly
Hall of the Fine Arts Building&mdash;an event which has already filled
us with the keenest anticipations. There will be three on the war:&mdash;<em>Woman
and War</em>, <em>War and Christianity</em>, and <em>The Sanctity of Property
as a Cause of War</em>. There will be a series on the drama, as the
mirror of rebellion against the tyranny of the past:&mdash;an introductory
one on the significance of art in its relation to life, and others on
the new Scandinavian, Italian, German, French, Russian, Yiddish,
American, and English drama. These will be given on Sunday,
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights, and offer sufficient richness
for one season. But there is even more. On Monday and
Wednesday nights, at East End Hall on Erie and Clark Streets,
Miss Goldman will deliver six general propaganda lectures, all
dealing with the labor problem and the sex question. Tickets will
be on sale at the office of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>; at The Radical
Book Shop, 817½ North Clark Street; and may be had also from
Dr. Reitman, 3547 Ellis Avenue. How interesting it will be to
watch that part of the audience which attends the war and the
drama talks as perfectly &ldquo;safe&rdquo; subjects making its discovery that
the lecturer is a woman of simple nobility and sweetness, and that
her propaganda is a matter of truth rather than of terror.

it he asks if <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> will not succeed in creating a
<em>Drang und Sturm</em> epoch; if it will not &ldquo;stir the hearts of college
men and women&mdash;those who have not yet been completely philistinized

other countries have always been the torch-bearers, the advance-guard
and martyrs in the fights for truth and ideals.&rdquo; It was a
definite impulse in this direction which gave birth to <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>; and while, after seven months, we cannot hope to have
turned the world inside out the way it should be turned, we are
sufficiently sanguine to believe that we have made a beginning. We
are so close to the <em>Drang und Sturm</em> ourselves that perhaps we
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
cannot see clearly. But we can hope, with that intensity which
makes <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> our religion, that these things will come
to pass. Incidentally, we believe in colleges on the same general
basis that we believe in many other disciplines: it is impossible ever
to learn too much on any subject. But we know there is something
seriously wrong with the colleges; and a far graver danger than
philistinization seems to us to lie in that hysterical confusion of
values which causes our college students to see small things as big
ones and to let the big ones slip by.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">astern</span> publishers have been much amused by the advertising of
<em>The Eyes of the World</em> spread over full pages of the recent magazines.
The burden of the appeal to the public is, first, that we have been overrun
with immoral books; second, that clergymen, editors, and all other forces
of decency are powerless to stop the flood; third, that Mr. Harold Bell
Wright has sprung to the front as the great leader against the vicious influence
of the other writers by the production of his latest novel; and fourth,
that the whole battle will be won if the public will step into the nearest bookshop
and pay $1.35 net for Mr. Wright&rsquo;s book. From the glowing moral
tone of the advertisement one might think it the work of an uplift committee;
but in small type at the bottom is a copyright notice bearing the name
of the president of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s publishing house. This gentleman is
undoubtedly deeply sincere in his admiration of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s work and its
influence, but in this case his admiration has led him to a somewhat ingenuous
confusion of moral and business motives. It reminds one of the
tactics of the billboard advertising men who, when they discovered that
billboard advertising was being strongly attacked by those who object to the
disfigurement of our countryside, put up a large number of biblical posters
to curry favor with simple religious souls&mdash;and were afterwards so injudicious
as to boast of their cleverness in <em>Printer&rsquo;s Ink</em>.
</p>

<p>
The effectiveness of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s plea is somewhat prejudiced by his
own case. His novel sets forth the thesis that in order to make an artistic
or literary success it is necessary only to resort to flattery and corruption.
But his own novels have for some years been far more popular than those of
most competitors. Is it pure perversity that makes his hated rivals reject his
obviously successful methods in favor of the despicable ones which he so
vehemently attacks?
</p>

<p>
We wish only that someone with an equal enthusiasm for artistically
moral literature would try a similar advertising campaign for a genuine
artist. Such advertisements might set forth the facts that the bookshops
are being overrun with mediocre novels which make successes by pandering
to untruth and public prejudice, that the work of genius is in danger of
being choked out by the insincere product of commercial writers, and that
the best way to promote the interests of good literature would be to buy
in large quantities the novels of John Galsworthy or Romain Rolland! But,
alas, such a campaign is impossible in a commercial democracy&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t
pay!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
A respectable number of the best publishers have already aroused
themselves to the impropriety&mdash;or at least to the eventual ineffectiveness&mdash;of
announcing extreme praises of their own publications even in the critical
vein. Surely the book-reading public can&rsquo;t be made to believe that four or
five &ldquo;great novels&rdquo; are issued every year. Surely they would be grateful
for a little genuine information about the books they are asked to buy. And
so these publishers have issued for two years a monthly circular entitled
<em>New Books</em>, which contains descriptions of important new publications without
praise of any kind. It would be telling tales out of school to say how
carefully the publishers&rsquo; copy-writers must be watched in order to prevent
them from slipping dubious phrases into their notes. Some advertising men
seem to have principles against giving any candid information about what
they have for sale. But the task has been accomplished so far, and it
remains to be seen whether this civilized form of advertising can make much
progress against the advertising vandalism which destroys the effectiveness
of all publicity by extravagant statements. One begins to suspect that the
effort is pitifully Utopian in a state of economic savagery like the present,
where every man&rsquo;s attention is more naturally directed to his profits than
to the honesty of his work. The chances would be better if the majority
of the public knew what intellectual honesty is and really wanted it.
</p>

<p>
There is hope among the magazines in the form of <em>The Metropolitan</em>.
That is making a commercial success and is also attempting to publish genuine
work&mdash;not necessarily &ldquo;highbrow,&rdquo; but at least genuine. An expert
on an important subject recently wished to write a magazine article. The
first editor he approached recast the material to suit his own ideas. A
second and a third told him that his message was good, but over the heads
of the public; they ordered &ldquo;popular&rdquo; and ephemeral trivialities. <em>The Metropolitan</em>
is the only magazine that wanted him to write, in his own way,
what he really had to say. Another writer submitted the outline of an
article to a <em>Metropolitan</em> editor. It was on a subject ordinarily considered
somewhat &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo; The editor said: &ldquo;That is new, and interesting.
It ought to make a good article. You must be careful of only one thing.
Be absolutely frank. Don&rsquo;t try to gloss over anything that is a plain matter
of fact.&rdquo; Such directness is astounding to one accustomed to the ways of
editors.
</p>

<p>
An editor has recently confessed to me that now for the first time he
begins to believe that the popular magazines may have a really good reason
for existence, aside from furnishing amusement in hours of train and family
boredom. He thinks that the tremendous events in Europe are likely to
bring forth literature of worth and quickened emotion which nevertheless
cannot wait for book publication, and that so we shall find use for the more
ephemeral medium. It certainly is true that the keen public interest in the
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
war is likely to decline even before the war is over. We are bound to
experience a reaction in favor of reading matter at the opposite pole of
thought.
</p>

<p>
An incredible rumor that Hearst has bought <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> is
as startling as many of the war headlines which occur when no authentic
news is available. In spite of the absurdity of the idea, it has possibilities
of momentary amusement. What a retribution to overtake the spinsterly
Bostonese journal which tries with such a brown and wren-like conscience
to be judiciously radical!

<em>Poems</em>, by George Cronyn. [The Glebe. Albert and Charles Boni, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> am very sorry indeed that this book arrived when most of our space
was pre-empted. I need room for the sort of appreciation that I feel for
these poems.
</p>

<p>
That extraordinary, delightful, and Quixotic institution, <em>The Glebe</em>,
which insists on publishing stuff on its merits, apart from considerations
of popularity, has had divine luck in finding Cronyn,&mdash;whoever he is.
</p>

<p>
For Cronyn is a poet. Not just a versifier, but a poet. His verse has
a facility which does not detract from its beauty. I have encountered sheer
beauty more often in his book than in any volume of modern poetry that I
have read for some time.

Here is a sample:

This is just a short and rather exuberant message to <span class="smallcaps">Little Review</span>
readers, because I think they really deserve the pleasure of discovering
Cronyn for themselves.

<p class="book">
<em>Songs for the New Age</em>, by James Oppenheim. [The Century Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
One of the phenomena of the evolution of man is the constant broadening
of consciousness. We become accustomed to the sharing of our feelings
with larger and larger numbers of people; our identity with the race,&mdash;and
even with inanimate things,&mdash;becomes increasingly plain to us through
both the findings of science and heightened emotional receptivity.
</p>

<p>
And yet this wider consciousness by no means lessens the value or
quality of personality. By a splendid paradox, the more we realize our
inseparability with all life the more does our selfhood become accentuated.
Thus is achieved the marriage of Democracy and Individualism. We find
that, in the end, the cultivation of one is the nourishing of the other. I
need hardly mention that I am not alluding to that similacrum of equality:
political democracy.
</p>

<p>
This must be known to appreciate the message of James Oppenheim.
For it is pre-eminently as a message that these poems should be treated.
They are of essential value as one of the most articulate efforts to translate
that which in most people is mute.
</p>

<p>
There is an unmistakable kinship with Whitman in this work; not
merely in the form,&mdash;which is here termed &ldquo;polyrhythmic,&rdquo;&mdash;but in the
spirit, without hint of plagiarism or of abject imitation. Also we have the
same breezy contempt for the petty trappings of civilization.
</p>

<p>
Here is an extract from the poem, <em>Tasting the Earth</em>, which has beauty
as well as truth:

<p class="noindent">
This is enough to make one grateful to Mr. Oppenheim. But not always
plays the cosmic symphony; sometimes the spheric strains relax for a few
slender lyrics to a moving-picture lady or for the tender song to Annie, the
working-girl. We leave the book with the conception of a manly and
impressionable personality with a healthy lust for life, a deep insight into
the world-soul and his own soul (which, after all, are the same), and great
power to communicate his findings to us through a plastic and peculiarly
individual medium.

An American Anarchist
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Selected Works of Voltairine de Cleyre.</em> [Mother Earth Publishing Association,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Into every generation are born certain personalities that have the gift
of attracting vast multitudes within their orbit, dominating them, animating
them with a single purpose, directing them to a common goal. There are
other personalities more richly gifted, of more extended vision, who nevertheless
live and die unknown to the greater number of their contemporaries.
Aristocrats of the mind, these latter disdain to practice the arts by which
popularity is gained and held. They attract, but do not seek to dominate.
They persuade, but never command. Their passion is without hysteria;
their moral indignation is without personal rancor. They cherish ideals, but
harbor no illusions. They will gladly surrender life itself for an idea, but
they will not shriek for it. Our popular leaders are not seldom led by those
who seem to follow. These others advance alone. If they are followed it is
without their solicitation. To say that the individualist writer and lecturer
whose collected writings are now before us was such a personality may
seem exaggerated praise. If so, I have no apology to offer. I only ask
that, until you have read the lectures, poems, stories, and sketches which this
book contains you will suspend judgment.
</p>

<p>
Voltairine de Cleyre belonged to the school of thinkers that has suffered
most from the misrepresentations and misunderstanding of the unthinking
crowd; the school which numbers among its adherents men like
Stirner, Ibsen, and, in some aspects of his teaching, Nietzsche; the school
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
that sees hope of social regeneration only in the sovereignty of the individual
and the total abolition of the state. She belonged to it because she
was at once logician and poet, with a temperament abnormally rebellious
against tyranny and an imagination abnormally responsive to every form of
suffering.
</p>

<p>
It has often been remarked that anarchism takes root most readily in
those minds that have endured most oppression. Thus Russia, the home
of absolute political despotism, is also the birthplace of Bakunin, Hertzen,
Kropotkin, and Tolstoy. In America, where what Mencken calls &ldquo;the new
puritanism&rdquo; operates more oppressively than political government, it is in
behalf of sex freedom that most frequent and vehement protest is heard.
</p>

<p>
In the case of Voltairine de Cleyre this reaction declared itself neither
because of political nor of sexual restraint. It came about in the realm of
religion. It began from the moment when, at the age of twelve, the sensitive
gifted girl was placed in the hands of a Roman Catholic sisterhood,
presumably that her education might be safe. For four years the young
Voltairine lived at the convent of Our Lady of Lake Huron at Sarnia,
Ontario, heartsick with loneliness, writhing under the padded yoke of conventual
discipline, gathering within her soul that flame which was never
destined to be quenched save in death. Out of that experience she came
with a mind wholly emancipated from the dogmas of religion. Not long
afterward she entered upon what promised to be a brilliant career as a
secularist lecturer.
</p>

<p>
That a nature like hers would long confine itself to labor in the barren
field of theological controversy was not to have been expected. She was too
vital, too human. It is possible that the delicacy of her own health intensified
her sense of the world pain. Her sympathies are not alone of the intellect
but of the nerves. One feels the nerve torture of an imaginative and
poetic invalid in her confession of the reasons which had drawn her to adopt
the anarchist propaganda. She pictures herself as standing upon a mighty
hill from which she writes:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I saw the roofs of the workshops of the little world. I saw the machines, the
things that men had made to ease their burden, the wonderful things, the iron genii,
I saw them set their iron teeth in the living flesh of the men who made them; I saw
the maimed and crumpled stumps of men go limping away into the night that engulfs
the poor, perhaps to be thrown up in the flotsam and jetsam of beggary for a time,
perhaps to suicide in some dim corner where the black surge throws its slime. I saw
the rose fire of the furnace shining on the blanched face of the man who tended it,
and knew surely, as I knew anything in life, that never would a free man feed his
blood to the fire like that.
</p>

<p>
I saw swart bodies, all mangled and crushed, borne from the mouths of the mines
to be stowed away in a grave hardly less narrow and dark than that in which the
living form had crouched ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day; and I knew that in order
that I might be warm&mdash;I and you, and those others who never do any dirty work&mdash;those
men had slaved away in those black graves and been crushed to death at last.
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
I saw beside city streets great heaps of horrible colored earth, and down at the bottom
of the trench from which it was thrown, so far down that nothing else was visible,
bright gleaming eyes, like a wild animal hunted into its hole. And I knew that free
men never chose to labor there, with pick and shovel, in that foul, sewage-soaked
earth, in that narrow trench, in that deadly sewer gas ten, eight, even six hours a day.
Only slaves would do it.
</p>

<p>
I saw deep down in the hull of the ocean liner the men who shoveled the coal&mdash;burned
and seared like paper before the grate; and I knew that &ldquo;the record&rdquo; of the
beautiful monster, and the pleasure of the ladies who laughed on the deck, were paid
for with those withered bodies and souls. I saw the scavenger carts go up and down,
drawn by sad brutes and driven by sadder ones; for never a man, a man in full possession
of his selfhood, would freely choose to spend all his days in the nauseating
stench that forces him to swill alcohol to neutralize it. And I saw in the lead works
how men were poisoned, and in the sugar refineries how they went insane; and in the
factories how they lost their decency; and in the stores how they learned to lie;
and I knew it was slavery made them do all this.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
And against such slavery this young Amazon of the spirit (for at
this time, 1887, she was only twenty-one) declared a life-long warfare.
In so doing she separated herself from those who would otherwise have
been her natural allies and cut off those opportunities for worldly success
which must in the ordinary course of things have come to her.
</p>

<p>
Finding the cause of economic slavery not in capitalism, as do the
socialists, but in the government of man by man through which capitalism
is made possible, she was isolated still further from her contemporaries.
Hence the obscurity in which her life was passed. Hence the fact that until
her death in 1912 she lived quietly, teaching English to the newly-arrived
immigrant, scattering about her the treasure of a richly-stored mind as
freely as the south wind scatters the perfume it has gathered from the
garden in its path. If she had lived nearer to the plane of the generally-accepted
culture Voltairine de Cleyre might have gained a recognized place
among the foremost women of her time.
</p>

<p>
As it was she gave us in her lectures, now for the first time offered to
the public, the most comprehensive exposition of philosophical anarchism
that has appeared since the days of Proudhon and Stirner.

<h3 class="section" id="THE_GROWTH_OF_EVOLUTIONARY_THEORY">
The Growth of Evolutionary Theory
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Evolution Old and New</em>, by Samuel Butler. [E. P. Dutton and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
When <em>The Origin of Species</em> was published the world grouped itself
into two main camps. By far the larger of these took the attitude that
Darwin was an impious propounder of disgusting and dangerous heresy.
The smaller group hailed him as the bringer in of a new era.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
Samuel Butler allied himself with neither group, but took the attitude
of a constructive critic. In these pages he attacks contemporary Darwinism&mdash;using
the term in the narrow sense&mdash;on two grounds. That it is not the
novelty it is generally supposed to be, on the one hand, and that the
mechanism implied by its theory is not true, on the other hand, are his
main points.
</p>

<p>
In so far as Butler treats the first contention, his book is even today
of value. He describes the pre-Darwinian theories of evolution, especially
those of Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, and he strives to show that their
explanations or provisional explanations were sometimes more near the
truth than was Darwin&rsquo;s over-emphasis upon the struggle for existence as
the controlling factor in the evolution of species.
</p>

<p>
Butler&rsquo;s own point of view is that evolution takes place in accordance
with a design, and it is this part of his book that will be of least importance
at the present day. He quotes Paley, the celebrated English theologian
and advocate of the deified architect idea of God, to show that animal
organisms do show evidences of what is, strictly speaking, design, and
which cannot be referred to the ordinary Darwinian explanations.
</p>

<p>
Butler differs from Paley, however, in placing the designer not outside
the cosmic flux of his working materials, but within the organism. Not God,
he says, but the ancestral memory of man is the designer. The individual
perishes, but his memory endures in his offspring and alters them in accordance
with the lessons of ancestral experience.
</p>

<p>
We have said that this is the least valuable part of the book, and it is
so for the reason that later biologists and philosophers with the biological
approach have considerably enlarged the field of speculation in this particular
realm. The theory of &ldquo;entelechies&rdquo; of Hans Driesch practically does
for organisms what Butler does in his idea of unconscious memory. On
the other hand, the new &ldquo;imminent teleology&rdquo; of Bergson gives us a new
angle on the whole question of design in nature.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, however, the majority of biologists are harking back
to a conception of evolution as a kind of mathematical proposition in which
all is given to start with, and in which the new is neither a new design nor
a spontaneous creation, but is simply a liberation from inhibition of what
was always implicit in the old. And the men of this school would never
consent to write a book like this of Butler&rsquo;s. &ldquo;To the seed pan and the
incubator&rdquo; is their cry. The time is not here when synthesis is either
advisable or even possible, they tell us. And until we hear further from
these modern experimenters the wise man will read Butler for his history
and prospective,&mdash;and for his humor,&mdash;but will not be guided by his theories,
which are the work, indeed, of a brilliant intellect, but one working
without our new data, and without experimental backing.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the style of the book is delightful, and all who enjoy controversy
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
and the play of dialectic should read it. Another class to
whom it can be recommended is that large class of people who accept their
view of evolution in the same spirit that an old lady accepts the Episcopalian
creed and are twice as dogmatic over it.

<h3 class="section" id="EMMA_GOLDMAN_AND_THE_MODERN_DRAMA">
Emma Goldman and the Modern Drama
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Social Significance of the Modern Drama</em>, by Emma Goldman. [Richard G.
Badger, Boston.]
</p>

<p class="note">
[<em>The points in which we disagree with the reviewer will be discussed
in a coming issue.&mdash;The Editor.</em>]
</p>

<p>
There is an element of the keenest adventure in one&rsquo;s first meeting with
a great personality, whether that encounter be in body or through the
medium of the written word. In the case of Emma Goldman I should judge
the latter to be the severer test, for on the printed page she must stand
and fall by the content of her message, unaided by the glamor of personal
magnetism and eloquence of the lecture platform. For my own part, I
should have preferred to have met her as the fiery orator than as the purveyor
of academic wares. And yet in this present performance she comes
forward not in the guise of the accustomed critic&mdash;on the contrary she is
very often quite uncritical&mdash;but rather as the social interpreter. In other
words, Emma Goldman is here what she has always been: the propagandist,
with the modern drama as her latest text.
</p>

<p>
And she has a mighty text! Because &ldquo;any mode of creative work,
which with true perception portrays social wrongs earnestly and boldly,
may be a greater menace to our social fabric and a more powerful inspiration
than the wildest harangue of the soapbox orator,&rdquo; she has chosen the
drama as the fittest medium &ldquo;to arouse the intellectuals of this country,
to make them realize their relation to the people, to the social unrest permeating
the atmosphere.&rdquo; The great iconoclasts of our time who have
spoken through the drama&mdash;Ibsen, Strindberg, Sudermann, Hauptmann,
Wedekind, Brieux, Shaw, Galsworthy, Tolstoi, Tchekhof, Gorki&mdash;she has
gathered together within one pair of covers to show us that their message
is her message:&mdash;Change not Compromise.
</p>

<p>
As she puts it in her foreword:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
They know that society has gone beyond the stage of patching up, and that man
must throw off the dead weight of the past, with all its ghosts and spooks, if he is
to go foot free to meet the future.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
Again and again she returns to her theme. In summarizing Ibsen&rsquo;s
stand:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Already in <em>Brand</em>, Henrick Ibsen demanded all or nothing,&mdash;no weak-kneed
moderation, no compromise of any sort in the struggle for the ideal.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
In praise of the author of <em>Damaged Goods</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Brieux is among the very few modern dramatists who go to the bottom of this
question by insisting on a complete social and economic change, which alone can free
us from the scourge of syphilis and other social plagues.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
In connection with Yeats&rsquo;s <em>Where There is Nothing</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It embodies the spirit of revolt itself, of that most constructive revolt which
begins with the destruction of every obstacle in the path of the new life that is to
grow on the débris of the old, when the paralyzing yoke of institutionalism shall
have been broken, and man left free to enjoy Life and Laughter.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Those who are a bit dubious of the &ldquo;Life and Laughter&rdquo; that will follow
the wholesale destruction of the past will have no difficulty in discovering
the shortcomings of Miss Goldman&rsquo;s method. They are the obvious
ones which of necessity befall the single-minded propagandist:&mdash;the intrusion
of dogma and platitude into the discussion, the wearying insistence
upon &ldquo;the moral&rdquo; of each play, the uncritical attitude of too-ready acquiescence
in the veracity of each dramatic picture of life, etc. Such critics might
point out that the artist, in spite of Strindberg&rsquo;s dictum, cannot be a mere
&ldquo;lay preacher popularizing the pressing questions of his time&rdquo;; that insofar
as he approaches art, he does not preach; that it is by virtue of this power
that Hervieux, for example, is a greater artist than his better-known contemporary,
Brieux. (By the way, why did Miss Goldman omit the greatest
of the French social dramatists?) These critics might even throw in a
word for the institutions of the past which Miss Goldman believes can be
as easily shed as an outworn cloak.
</p>

<p>
But one must not be an orthodox Anarchist to recognize the superficiality
of these shortcomings which are the inevitable luggage of the
preacher. For Miss Goldman is a preacher. Any interpreter works in
accordance with his creed. Having taken to heart the fate of Lot&rsquo;s wife,
Miss Goldman has turned her back fiercely upon the past. Grant her this
hypothesis and she is always logical and coherent and never irrelevant.
And why shouldn&rsquo;t we encourage her to forge boldly ahead, disdainful of
the old bondage? We need her courage, her single-mindedness, and the
aim to which she has vowed them. She is not alone, for many who know her
not chant the same litany. As for the danger to society that lurks in her
philosophy, we must not forget that the great conservative mass is leavened
slowly. And in the end it is time alone who can give the verdict&mdash;whether
we shall patch up the old fabric, or destroy and begin our weaving anew.

The Whining of a Rejected One
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Oscar Wilde and Myself</em>, by Lord Alfred Douglas. [Duffield and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Emma Goldman gave this laconic epithet to this latest pearl of scandal-literature.
Mylord is very much in earnest, hence his pitiful failure to see
the humorous side of his pathetic self-spanking. The modest title of the
book obviously suggests the two-fold purpose of the titular harlequin&mdash;his
own aggrandizement and the dethronement of the Prince of Paradoxes.
He excellently succeeds in obtaining the reverse result of his first endeavor;
not even his pugilistic father, the Marquis of Queensbury, could have given
him a more thorough boxing than the one he so earnestly performs over his
own ears. As to his other ambition, that of vying with the laurels of Herostrates
in his attempt to belittle the dead lion, we must admit his success in
one point, in proving the morbid vanity of Wilde. What but the passion
for titular acquaintances could have induced the author of <em>Salome</em> to chum
with Bosie Douglas, this burlesque snob, so utterly shallow, petty, so hopelessly
stupid and arrogant?
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know what to admire more: the &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; of the publisher or the
sense of humor of the author.

<h3 class="section" id="A_NEW_SHORT_STORY_WRITER">
A New Short Story Writer
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Life Is a Dream</em>, by Richard Curle. [Doubleday, Page and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is to be hoped that Richard Curle will not long remain a name unfamiliar
to American readers, for he is a writer of marked and unusual talent.
<em>Life Is a Dream</em> is the first of his books to be published in this country, and,
consisting as it does of short stories, it can scarcely find as large an audience
as it deserves. For there can be no doubt that volumes of short
stories have only a modest sale&mdash;Kipling and O. Henry to the contrary
notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
In Curle&rsquo;s case this is a great pity, for the stories in <em>Life Is a Dream</em>
are every one of them remarkable and they have not been printed elsewhere.
They are not what we are accustomed to; almost any magazine editor
would reject them, if only because they have none of that &ldquo;punch&rdquo; which
so largely characterizes the work of Kipling and O. Henry, not to mention
the other and far smaller people. It is difficult for the man who
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
writes stories without &ldquo;punch&rdquo; to procure a hearing; the great popular
magazines will have none of him; style, craftsmanship, subtle psychology,
exquisite color&mdash;none of these (and Curle is a master of them all) can
quite atone for lack of that predominant American quality. And that is
why Richard Curle, working as he has thus far in a genre that appeals,
however strongly, still to only a few, may be long in securing the recognition
that is already quite his due.
</p>

<p>
There are nine stories of varying length in the present volume. They
take you to the corners of the earth&mdash;London, Damascus, Spain, the West
Indies, the high seas, Central America&mdash;and their spirit is well suggested
in the title of the collection&mdash;<em>La Vida Es Sueno</em>. Truly they are such stuff
as dreams are made of. Curle&rsquo;s feeling for the colorful word, the precise
phrase is remarkable; in a moment one feels almost bodily transported to
a strange and fascinating land. And then the story is unfolded&mdash;for these
are real stories and never mere impressionistic sketches. They may not
be about the sort of people you are likely to number among your friends,
but they are about very human folk just the same. They have a subtlety
that is never too involved and an engaging frankness which is one of Curle&rsquo;s
greatest charms.
</p>

<p>
<em>Old Hoskyns</em>, almost homely in its simplicity, is a very touching tale.
<em>Going Home</em> is an exquisite bit of irony. <em>The Look Out Man</em>&mdash;slight
though it is&mdash;is profoundly tragic. In <em>A Remittance Man</em>, little by little,
like a mosaic, a shrewd, penetrating, and very convincing picture is built
up of a man who has lost his grip on life. And so they go&mdash;Curle knows
the people of his tales so well! He is careful never to tell you too much
about them&mdash;there is ample opportunity after each narrative for pleasant
speculation&mdash;but one never feels that the real story he set out to tell has
not been fully told.
</p>

<p>
It is equally important that Curle knows intimately the places he
chooses as settings for his stories. Most of this knowledge he has gained
in his amazingly extensive travels. Aside from North America he has visited
almost every corner of the earth. And yet it is none the less very
remarkable&mdash;this curious ability to paint atmosphere&mdash;a talent not too often
associated with those who write in English. Conrad has it, and the greater
continental writers&mdash;and Curle has studied them to advantage. I should
have myself to possess this same ability to make you realize the peculiar
fascination of such a story as <em>The Emerald Seeker</em>. It is a fine and thrilling
yarn; no matter that&mdash;there are many who can tell a rattling tale. But I
doubt if any could approach Curle&rsquo;s masterly sketching of his milieu&mdash;a
page or two, and in a very real sense you feel yourself in the heart of tropical
Central America. Finally and best of all, you know that the color is
never there merely for its own sake; there is always a real story to be
told and to its telling the background merely adds distinction. It is difficult&mdash;trying
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
to show the peculiar charm and interest of Curle&rsquo;s work. But
once you read him, it becomes very apparent.
</p>

<p>
Richard Curle is only thirty years old. If the promise of <em>Life Is a
Dream</em> is fulfilled, he should be one of the really significant writers of his
day. He has traveled widely and is widely read; he knows not only men
and places, but books as well&mdash;particularly the works of the great Russian
and Frenchmen. Among living writers he admires especially Joseph Conrad,
with whose work his own has a certain kinship. Curiously enough
he has written the first adequate book on Conrad and it is shortly to be
published in America. It will reveal Curle as a critic of sympathy, insight
and independence. Meanwhile every lover of good fiction, everyone who
cares for skillful craftsmanship in literature, and all those adventurous
persons who would see strange lands and people should read <em>Life Is a
Dream</em>.

<h3 class="section" id="A_NEW_STUDY_OF_WILLIAM_MORRIS">
A New Study of William Morris
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>William Morris</em>, by A. Clutton-Brock. [Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I dislike that method which many historians pursue, treating the past
as a matter of death instead of life. For a baggage of rags and a jumble of
bleached bones I have no concern. Yesterday is a thing I will not consider.
History is a proof of one thing only:&mdash;that circumstance is a fraud, and that
personality is a durability with eternity. The soul writes its autobiography,
and those used for the syllables survive the seasons and the years. Rule
and custom and people who are no more than these are for the scrap heap.
Night comes and swallows the dead. History is nothing except for its exceptions.
Nature&rsquo;s royal men we discover despite their uniforms. We note
not their habiliments; they have a natural tongue and true approach and
are masters of the seconds. They breathe life lustily still. These are the
verities. They are descriptive not of antiquity but of the mind which is
now. They show us who we are. We love them because of this. Every
time we read them we embark on a new voyage, and discover to ourselves a
treasure island of which hitherto we had not the slightest knowledge. Trojans
of truth, they lift their spears to the central sun, to proclaim the splendor
of the individual, the great reality of the Now. Through them we are
made aware how rich we are, we begin to realize somewhat of our depths;
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
they provide a new courage, give a new hope, and inspire us for the struggle
ahead with the quality of an unwonted self-reliance.
</p>

<p>
I have probably gone beyond my office in making these remarks, but
the temptation provided by the biography of William Morris proved so
strong that I could not forego them. Here is a man of whom we cannot
know too much. An artist who gave his life for art&mdash;what shall we say
of him?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brock has told a little of the man, sometimes in an interesting way,
but he does not make us intimate with him. However, as he tells us in his
preface, he had no pretensions. He is lucid and thoughtful, he is excellent
in his criticism of Morris&rsquo;s poetry, and on the whole gives us a book well
worthy of an hour&rsquo;s quietude. The facts given are good by way of an
introduction&mdash;sufficient to send one in quest for greater knowledge of the
man.
</p>

<p>
One of Nature&rsquo;s henchmen, fresh, bold, Viking in the marrow, with a
spirit of steel, a man for whom the sea would smile, poet, painter, stainer
of glass, weaver of carpets, spinning a world with the strains of his song,
socialist and revolutionist, Morris comes as a teasing wind through the dank
atmosphere of nineteenth-century commercialism, daring conventions and
going his way a body all soul, a majesty supreme to the last.
</p>

<p>
We get a little of the air of the man when we read these lines from the
<em>Sigurd</em>. I quote from the biography:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old,</p>
      <p class="verse">Dukes were the door wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold;</p>
      <p class="verse">Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed the doors;</p>
      <p class="verse">Earls&rsquo; wives were the weaving women, queens&rsquo; daughters strewed the floor.</p>
      <p class="verse">And the masters of its song craft were the mightiest men that cast</p>
      <p class="verse">The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
One cannot but remark the manhood and courage of this. A Luxury of
Life. A freedom here that would fill the winds. It is not to be wondered
that such a man should chafe under the tyranny of skin-girt stupidity,
and feel a loathing toward the flannel-souled people who in his time were
already making machines of men and building a world around them of
ugliness,&mdash;cities without bearing, without character, without mirth, without
life. Cities of the dead, where ghosts might abide.
</p>

<p>
It is in the realm of art, however, that we must look for Morris would
we view him in the light. Art gave the world a child who would lead it
by the hand to the Princess Beautiful that the maiden should have a lover
to woo. A child&mdash;yes; and a warrior too, who would do battle with any of
her enemies. I would not say that he knew more of art in its relation to life
than did Ruskin, Wilde, and Whistler; he was, however, far more active of
the purpose. He saw that art was not a mere thing for the galleries, where
Mediocrity can sniff and vaunt its conceits; for him it was serious of all
nature, of the whole circle and the endless series of circles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
That which gives ear to the tongues of stones and from marble
delivers its soul, he wanted Life to seek. There was a spice in art for
Morris which made it dangerous for milk-sops. Art for him was a Reality;
the existence around him a fraud, and Life a cowardice. He had Truth on
his side; he hated shams and he joined the socialist movement because he
saw here a means for their overturning. In a very interesting chapter
Mr. Brock tells how Morris, after breakfasting with Burne-Jones, would go
out to some street corner and lecture on socialism to a throng of workingmen,
some dirty and in rags. He had his courage&mdash;this man.
</p>

<p>
There dwells in each of us a heroism of which the last has not been
spoken. Carlyle was drunk with it, Emerson wrote it, Morris lived it. A
great artist, but a greater man. Life for him was a cavalier extravagance&mdash;thus
would he have all men live. To make the world live, we must give of
our living. Breathe life into all things that they too will have manners and
extend a friendship&rsquo;s greetings.
</p>

<p>
For practical people Morris is still anathema; for human beings, however,
he is yet a comrade in the struggle. Mr. Brock&rsquo;s study of him is
therefore welcome, coming as it does with fresh intelligence of his nature.
His book most certainly is a thing to be read.

Exaggerated Mushrooms
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Minions of the Moon</em>, by Madison Cawein. [Stewart and Kidd, Cincinnati.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
At a glance the book seems merely a collection of unusual nursery-rhymes,
but after a careful reading one finds little glimmers of poetry, like
<a id="corr-22"></a>faded flowers touched with sulphur and pressed between the leaves of a
very inane volume. If you have the sublime suggestion of patience necessary
to turn the leaves of the book you will rather delight in fingering the
flowers. They are moon-light flowers. Mr. Cawein is at his best when he
goes into his usual tremulous raptures over moon-light. His moon-light
poems actually drip with slim, wistful (to use a much-abused word) color.
If he could forget elfs, fairies, and mushrooms for more than a moment,
Madison Cawein would reach the plateaus, if not the mountain-tips of poetry.
But he can only cast out the trite child which has taken possession of him,
now and then. Strange to say, though three or four of the poems in the
volume are good, they do not contain a line worth quoting. Their halfbeauty
lies in the ensemble. As for the rest of the book, I can best describe
it by saying that one feels inclined to turn over the page.

<p>
<em>The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd</em>, by D. H. Lawrence. [Mitchell Kennerley,
New York.] A three-act drama, by a young English poet, that
feels into new recesses of the problem of sex relationships. Clear thinking,
acute analysis, and provocative criticisms of life make this a notable addition
to <em>The Modern Drama Series</em>.
</p>

<p>
<em>An Island Outpost</em>, by Mary E. Waller. [Little, Brown and Company,
Boston.] &ldquo;I respect the clam,&rdquo; says Miss Waller; &ldquo;it has certain reserves.&rdquo;
She also says: &ldquo;Liberty is the restraint of controlled intelligence,&rdquo; and she
tells us that a million ideas unloaded on an unwarned public will cause
befogment of its reasoning powers. Miss Waller in her <em>Island Outpost</em> has
not shown the reserve of the clam, nor the restraint of controlled intelligence,
but has unloaded her &ldquo;million ideas on a million subjects unannounced
and uncatalogued.&rdquo; Socrates, Swedes, and Simians, Hull House and Helsingfors,
Praxiteles and Plum Jelly, Clucking Hens and Chemistry, Philanthropic
Frenzies, Psychiatry Astigmatic, Outlooks, and Intellectual Miasma
overlap each other in &ldquo;indecent haste&rdquo;&mdash;and to cap all comes an analogy
taken from old &ldquo;turned carpets,&rdquo; suggestive of prehistoric methods of sanitation
to a mere &ldquo;Westerner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<em>Gillespie</em>, by J. MacDougall Hay. [George H. Doran Company, New
York.] A big story of heroic Scotch life by a new writer who has tremendous
power. It makes that kind of profound personal impressions which
a well-bred man refuses to discuss.
</p>

<p>
<em>Songs and Poems</em>, by Martin Schütze. [The Laurentian Publishers,
Chicago.] The discriminating reader who is a bit wearied of the &ldquo;free
verse&rdquo; of &ldquo;free poets&rdquo; will find refreshing contrast in this slender volume
of Mr. Schütze. Here there is beauty combined with delicate craftsmanship;
lines finely wrought, fresh rhythms, uncommon phrasing. The contents
reveals a happy versatility: there are a variety of Songs, some Poems,
Discourses, and Epigrams.
</p>

<p>
<em>When Love Flies Out o&rsquo; the Window</em>, by Leonard Merrick. [Mitchell
Kennerley, New York.] A pretty story of the love affair of a charming
chorus girl and a novelist-journalist. It should make good late summer
reading, for the route of true love is not over-smooth, and the end is
happy. We recommend the earlier portion of the book as done in the
inimitable Merrick fashion. It is rather too bad that this author&rsquo;s sustained
performances fall so far below his short stories.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
<em>The Man and the Woman</em>, by Arthur L. Salmon. [Forbes and Company,
Chicago.] A comforting little volume for smug Victorian women of
both sexes.
</p>

<p>
<em>Short Plays</em>, by Mary Macmillan. [Stewart and Kidd Company, Cincinnati.]
Ten short plays deftly done, and sufficiently varied in theme to
meet the diverse demands of the woman&rsquo;s club, the girls&rsquo; school, and the
amateur dramatic society.
</p>

<p>
<em>English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century</em>, by George
Henry Nettleton. [The Macmillan Company, New York.] Interesting
to academic students of the historical facts of the early periods of the modern
English drama.
</p>

<p>
<em>Erna Vitek</em>, by Alfred Kreymborg. [Albert and Charles Boni, New
York.] This further enterprise of a new and daring publishing house is an
attempt, and a promising one at that, at the naturalistic American novel.
But it is only an attempt. Mr. Kreymborg&rsquo;s style is marred by the very
frequent use of journalese. He has an excellent plot, but the treatment has
somewhat failed to do it justice. Also, it seems to us that the episode
narrated in the book would have made a far better short story than a novel.
Despite these defects of juvenility, the book gives promise of future work
by this author that will surely count. Also one obtains a refreshing insight
into the real New York Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
<em>A Stepdaughter of the Prairie</em>, by Margaret Lynn. [The Macmillan
Company, New York.] Vivid impressions of pioneer life in the Missouri
Valley by a writer who knows the wide prairies of that region.
</p>

<p>
<em>Business: A Profession</em>, by Louis D. Brandeis. [Small, Maynard and
Company, Boston.] A book composed of the lectures, essays and discussions
which gave rise to the efficiency idea in big business management. It
belongs on the shelf with President Wilson&rsquo;s <em>The New Freedom</em>.
</p>

<p>
<em>London and Paris</em>, by Prof. John C. Van Dyke. [Charles Scribner&rsquo;s
Sons, New York.] Two additions to the <em>New Guides to Old Masters Series</em>
that point out to conventional visitors the things that they should see when
they look at the pictures in the famous galleries of London and Paris.
</p>

<p>
<em>Letters from a Living Dead Man</em>, dictated to Elsa Barker. [Mitchell

to be. Psychical researchers will salt this thing down with their &ldquo;facts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<em>Where Rolls the Oregon</em>, by Dallas Lore Sharp. [Houghton Mifflin
Company, Boston.] A group of delightful impressions of &ldquo;the vast outdoors
of Oregon&rdquo; by an interpretative observer whose zestful phraseology
is full of local atmosphere. A number of charming halftones are included.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
<em>The Red Light of Mars</em>, by George Bronson-Howard. [Mitchell Kennerley,
New York.] This philosophical comedy in three acts, which adds
creditable variety and interest to <em>The Modern Drama Series</em>, will be staged
this season. Being typically American in spirit, it lacks iron in the body of
its thought.
</p>

<p>
<em>Bambi</em>, by Marjorie Benton Cook. [Doubleday, Page and Company,
New York.] &ldquo;<em>Bambi</em>&rdquo; is altogether delightful. After marrying a writer of
impossible plays, she endeavors to support him and to teach him to support
himself. She becomes an author, and with her delicious vanity, and knowledge
of her ability to wind men around her tiny finger, uses her own fame
as a lever to place her husband among the successful playwrights. This
sprightly midget is one of the most lovable characters we have met in many
moons.

that merciless bomb into the camp of provincial complacency prevailing in this

<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> bubbles over with enthusiasm and love of life. Here is an
instance of a losing fight with life&mdash;perhaps it may interest you.
</p>

<p>
A childhood spent in the slums of a large city&mdash;not in the camaraderie spirit
of the slums but within the close bounds of a little clean apartment presided over by
an aristocratic-notioned mother. Absolute barrenness of childhood experience&mdash;not
a toy, never even a rag doll, not a tree, not a flower, not a picture
of any beauty&mdash;a household of petty quarreling and incessant scrubbing
and cleaning, and strict adherence to duties. As the child, now grown,
thinks back, she knows that there was always a subconscious feeling of revolt. She
would often go off for many hours knowing that punishment would follow; she
destroyed much that caused tears in her efforts to create, she craved and found
affection where life was a little richer.
</p>

<p>
And then came books&mdash;avid, unsystematic reading. But life was never touched
intimately and directly from any angle but one of barrenness, pettiness. A routined
school course enriched living by a deep and lasting friendship. Continually the inner
revolt and the outward conforming dragged along together. And then came a time
of complete awakening, of burning whys, with realization of a dual existence and a
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
desire for sincerity in living above all things. Life demands some sort of a medium
of expression which has its beginning in childhood experience. A maturing mind
just beginning on impressions that should have come in childhood is a sorry spectacle.
Its desires are so out of proportion to its human possibilities that it flounders
and does nothing. It finds in itself capacities dulled for want of stimulation, it
looks on things and sees them out of relation to itself. One grows to despise
human beings, to hate living&mdash;to see that there is beauty and radiance in the world
only for the chosen ones who respond to it intimately and not only through day
dreams.
</p>

Youth is not always synonymous with love of life; the gutter does not always
hold a reflection of the sky, and a conversation or even understanding with one&rsquo;s
parents but seldom solves the problem of soul imprisonment. Breaking the bars of
immediate environment is not so wonderful a thing for an independent adult, but
how is one to overcome the barriers of a wasted childhood?

<em>C. A. Z., Chicago</em>:

<p>
What splendid letters those are from George Soule! Every one has been really
worth while and inspiring. Especially the advice and warning he gives in his last:
&ldquo;Let us go to the theatres next fall prepared to trace the beginnings of a new stage
art in this country; in the meantime, however, not hoping to escape the flood of
cheap and artistically vicious stuff with which the commercial managers will attempt
to drown our sensibilities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps after this warning one ought not become agitated or angry with any of
the productions of those showmen who are frankly in the business for the sake
of revenue. However, when the &ldquo;super&rdquo;-showman, who is said by the press-agent
to possess unconquerable ideals, does something that is supposed to be the uttermost
of stage production&mdash;and fails&mdash;well, then one can&rsquo;t help becoming irritated. In
a production of <em>Joseph and His Brethren</em> which I saw recently there is evidence
that he is aware of the presence of new ideas in the theatre. But nowhere is it
perfect enough or fearlessly new enough to be satisfying. What new ideas are used
are swamped under, in their imperfection, by the mass of &ldquo;excellent mediocrity&rdquo;
that Mr. Soule speaks of. In every act is present that hideous compromise&mdash;rank
mixture of the old theatrical devices with a cautious lifting of some daring modernists&rsquo;
best ideas. But the pictures received applause. Most came for the scene that
jarred most. It was a moon-light garden scene. The backdrop and sense of distance
were perfect, but stuck prominently in the foreground, on either side of the
stage, were huge clusters of pink blossoms. The applause for that was great&mdash;just
as Soule predicted.
</p>

<p>
Mixing ideals&mdash;so-called&mdash;with the business of attracting the crowd for what it
brings to the box-office may produce a super-showman and make of him a millionaire,
but it does not advance the cause of the theatre. Not only is the production
to be quarreled with, but the drama itself is of mongrel character. Everywhere is
evident that catering to the ordinary theatrical taste:&mdash;entire speeches from the bible
alongside those of modern idiom and thought together with re-arrangements and
useless additions to the already satisfying detail of the scriptures.
</p>

<p>
After a &ldquo;smashing&rdquo; finale with the gorgeously garmented multitude waving
dusty palms in a private house I decided to dismiss the entire show as fruitless,
so far as the &ldquo;new note&rdquo; was concerned. However, one critic writes that the German
and Russian moderns were suggested in some scenes and that the chief female
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
character might have been costumed by Bakst himself! That arouses one to the
danger of the thing. Is this the final word in the theatre and what we are to expect
as the best this season?

The July number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is before me, and the demure brown
cover brings a smile as I recall the stimulating sparkle and scarlet audacities hidden
beneath. After Nietzsche&rsquo;s notion of the Wagnerite, it is at least interesting to read
Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s description of pâte de foi-gras at the opera. The talk of Dr.
Brandes and the tedious speaker is a gladsome thing, but most of all I was held by
<em>The Renaissance of Parenthood</em>. It is a large subject for one article and too large
for a letter; nevertheless I must quarrel with one of your implications. I refuse to
admit that one can deduce anything whatever from the writings of Mr. George
Bernard Shaw. Don&rsquo;t mistake me: I feel sure that I agree with everything you
think about him&mdash;&ldquo;aye more.&rdquo; But I deny that you can justly follow any statement
of his with &ldquo;hence.&rdquo; When a man takes his authorized and adoring biographer and
tells him &ldquo;Lo! here is the house where I first saw the light,&rdquo; and, when the adoring
and authorized one comes a cropper because he deduces from this remark that
the self-same house is the birth place of his idol, it behooves one to walk warily
with this God! No doubt to read the profound and playful prophet philosopher
is to conclude that he believes &ldquo;the old-fashioned game in which the mother sacrificed
everything was unfair and unnecessary and wasteful.&rdquo; Equally, however,
there is no doubt that G. B. S. himself holds an entirely opposite point of view
since he emphatically affirms: &ldquo;When others thought I should be working to support
my mother, I made her work to support me. Five years after I was entirely
capable of earning a living, I kept her at it so that I could learn to write English&rdquo;;
and, to prove his rightness, he cries: &ldquo;And now look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;

This book is not an argument for equal suffrage, but rather a quiet

but preserves throughout the lightness of touch and urbanity of tone for which Dr. Crothers is so well
known. $1.25 net.

Sword Blades and Poppy Seed
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Amy Lowell
</p>

<p class="ads">
Author of &ldquo;The Dome of Many-Colored Glass.&rdquo; etc.
</p>

<p>
Of the poets who today are doing the interesting and original work,
there is no more striking and unique figure than Amy Lowell. The foremost
member of the &ldquo;Imagists&rdquo;&mdash;a group of poets that includes William
Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Hueffer&mdash;she has won wide recognition
for her writing in new and free forms of poetical expression.
</p>

<p>
Miss Lowell&rsquo;s present volume of poems, &ldquo;Sword Blades and Poppy
Seed,&rdquo; is an unusual book. It contains much perhaps that will arouse
criticism, but it is a new note in American poetry. Miss Lowell has
broken away from academic traditions and written, out of her own time,
real singing poetry, free, full of new effects and subtleties.

WINTERING HAY. By John Trevena.
</p>

<p class="r adp">
$1.35 net
</p>

<p>
A big and powerful story of a man&rsquo;s struggle to escape the consequences of an early sin, a
sin whose causes have their roots deep in his own nature. From Dartmoor he comes to London
(whose underworld Trevena depicts with a realism that savors of Dostoievsky) and finally expiates
his fault, but not until he has drained the cup of suffering to the dregs and altered not only his
own life but also the lives of those he loves.

SLEEPING WATERS. By John Trevena.

<p>
There is an old Dartmoor legend about the waters of Nymphala, which bring forgetfulness to
whoever drinks of them. A young priest comes to this spring, drinks and encounters, under
romantic circumstances, Petronel, spirit of the moor. An unusual and very beautiful love story
springs from this meeting, which ends in an unexpected but logical and wholly satisfying manner.

ALTOGETHER JANE. By Herself.

This is not a &ldquo;literary&rdquo; book. It is just the straight-forward, unadorned story of a fine, big-hearted
woman. Jane gives an intimate picture of the life that is lived by most women the world
over, and you will follow her narrative with breathless interest. It will impress you always with
its humor, its kindliness, but, above all, with its essential truth.

LIFE&rsquo;S LURE: A NOVEL. By John G. Neihardt.
</p>

<p class="r adp">
$1.25 net
</p>

<p>
A brisk and vigorous story of life in a Western mining camp. Mr. Neihardt shows you men
(and women) stripped of the frills and trivialities of our civilization and reduced to their more
fundamental and primitive selves. Always the lure of life, the mere desire above all else to live
dominates them.
</p>

<p>
A big-hearted book this, rich with pathos and with humor, with homely good nature no less
than with hideously cruel realism. You will not quickly forget Sam Drake, torn with hunger, crawling
on his hands and knees back to camp: nor great-hearted Ma Wooliver and Pete: nor poor little
Punkins (who should never have left the folks at Johnson Corner), dreaming everlastingly of nuggets
such as no man ever found. Mr. Neihardt knows such people as these; he knows our Western
country, and &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s Lure&rdquo; rings true from cover to cover.

ORTHODOXY: A PLAY IN ONE ACT. By Nina Wilcox Putnam.

<p class="r adp">
$ .60 net
</p>

<p>
Do you always say what you really think? Of course you don&rsquo;t; no one does. Only consider&mdash;you
meet a stranger&mdash;&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to meet you.&rdquo; But are you?
More often than otherwise you are not. Mrs. Putnam has exposed in a satiric, though not too
bitter spirit this most common of all of our little hypocrisies. In &ldquo;Orthodoxy&rdquo; her people say exactly
what in their hearts of hearts they are thinking, though they act as we all do. The result
is&mdash;to say the least&mdash;startling.

FATHER RALPH: A NOVEL. By Gerald O&rsquo;Donovan.
</p>

<p class="r adp">
$1.40 net
</p>

<p>
This novel of present-day Ireland enjoyed an immense success when it appeared in London
something over a year ago. Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan writes delightfully and possesses a style of real distinction.
&ldquo;Father Ralph&rdquo; presents a faithful picture of the life of the Irish people of today&mdash;particularly
of their religious life, which is analyzed with shrewdness, insight and humor. But the
book has, first of all, those enduring qualities that characterize all good fiction.

DRIFT AND MASTERY: AN ATTEMPT TO DIAGNOSE THE CURRENT
UNREST. By Walter Lippmann.
</p>

<p class="r adp">
$1.50 net
</p>

<p>
This is a book at once comprehensive, shrewd, vigorous, searching, and interesting&mdash;with
always a saving humor. In the course of sixteen chapters Mr. Lippmann discusses practically all
the more important problems of our political, social, and economic life, and the factors that have
brought about that curious unrest everywhere so noticeable.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Lippmann is a great deal more than a brilliant iconoclast&mdash;he deals not only with
the signs and causes of the present unrest, but with the order which is emerging from it.

THE LITTLE KING: A ONE ACT PLAY IN VERSE. By Witter Bynner.
</p>

<p class="r adp">
$ .60 net
</p>

<p>
No poet, subtle in sympathy and delicate of touch, ever created a more affecting situation than
that portrayed in this pathetic and simple tale of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s child. Abandoned to dissolute
keepers, The Little King, as he listens to his Mother&rsquo;s footsteps overhead, finds solace only in
the canary around whose tiny throat he has wound an ironical red patriotic ribbon. Instinctive
feeling for the essential dignity of royalty prevents his accepting escape at the cost of another&rsquo;s
freedom, and as the curtain falls the last glimmer of light is blotted from his cell and he is left in
lonely darkness. Such is the substance of Mr. Bynner&rsquo;s new play. It is written in his usual beautiful
and plastic verse.

A New Day Dawns in Tires
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
When Men Adopt No-Rim Cuts
</p>

<p>
<b>At least 400,000</b> men have proved this by
adopting Goodyear tires.
</p>

<p>
They find a matchless quality&mdash;standards
that never vary. They find sturdiness and
safety, less trouble, more mileage.
</p>

<p>
They find these four exclusive savings:
</p>

<p>
<b>No rim-cuts.</b> A way we control prevents
them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Less blow-outs</b>, because the &ldquo;On-Air&rdquo; cure&mdash;used
by us alone&mdash;removes a major cause.
</p>

<p>
<b>Loose tread</b> risk reduced by 60 per cent, by
a patent method we alone employ.
</p>

<p>
<b>Less punctures</b>&mdash;less wear&mdash;because of our
double-thick, very tough All-Weather tread.
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
In those four ways&mdash;combating your four
greatest tire troubles&mdash;No-Rim-Cuts excel
every other tire. When you adopt them&mdash;<b>and
the time will come</b>&mdash;you will know tire comfort,
tire security which will not be yours
until then.
</p>

<p>
The verdict of users proves that. Goodyear
tires&mdash;after 15 years of tests and comparisons&mdash;outsell
any other.
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
FOR WINTER TIRES
</p>

<p>
Now&mdash;when you buy for winter&mdash;get the
All-Weather tread. You&rsquo;ll use it when you
know it all the year around.
</p>

<p>
It is tough and double-thick, wear-resisting,
difficult to puncture. It is flat and regular,
so it runs like a plain tread. Its grips are
deep, so they last long. They are sharp-edged
and resistless.
</p>

<p>
Some anti-skids cost a great deal more.
But the All-Weather tread is the latest and
best. One glance will show that and every
test will prove it.
</p>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t know Goodyears it is time
you did. They are now winning new users
faster than ever before. Test them for your
own sake. Any dealer will supply you.

<p>
The author undertakes to show that the agencies which
are used in distributing the products of industry and are
responsible for the extremes in the social scale have never
been adopted by any rational action, but have come to be
through fortuitous circumstances and are without moral
basis. The wage system, as a means of distribution, is
utterly inadequate to measure the workers&rsquo; share. The
source of permanent improvement is found in social ownership,
which transfers the power over distribution from
the hands of those individuals who now own the instruments
of production to the hands of the people.

THE EGOIST
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
AN INDIVIDUALIST REVIEW
</p>

<p class="fl ada">
Editor: Harriet Shaw Weaver

<p>
THE EGOIST is written solely for intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
As its name implies THE EGOIST is an organ of individualistic thought.
</p>

<p>
In its columns writers are permitted to be themselves, and encouraged in
these courses to the great content of all upright and spirited people.
</p>

  <div class="narrow">
<p>
<em><span class="larger">The Egoist has no point d&rsquo;appui whatsoever
with any other English journal. It is unique.</span></em>
</p>

  </div>
<p>
Although THE EGOIST is intended for the intelligent it is read by most
of the well-known people in London. It succeeds however in scaring unintelligence
to a becoming humility.
</p>

<p>
Its articles on political philosophy are a special feature.
</p>

<p>
THE EGOIST is also, in some sort, the organ of the Imagistes. The
poetry published every fortnight in its columns is obviously the only interesting
poetical matter now being written in English. The Imagistes are nothing
if not self-appreciative. But then their critical tact is exquisite.
</p>

<p>
Let no one suppose that EGOIST writers have truck with the divers unseemly
poetical journals of their unhappy country.
</p>

<p>
Among the contributors to THE EGOIST are: Dora Marsden, Remy de
Gourmont, (translated by C. Sartoris and Richard Aldington), Ford Madox
Hueffer, Ezra Pound, F. S. Flint, Richard Aldington, Allen Upward, James
Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Frances Gregg, John Cournos, William Carlos Williams,
&ldquo;H. D.&rdquo; Skipwith Cannell, Reginald Wright Kauffman, Muriel Ciolkowska,
Huntly Carter.
</p>

<p>
THE EGOIST keeps its readers in close touch with modern French Literature.
</p>

<p class="s">
Subscriptions: A year, 13/ (U. S. A., $3.25); six months, 6/6 (U. S. A.,
$1.65); three months, 3/3 (U. S. A., 84 cents). Single copies post free 7d.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
